**Paladins of Awoudan** is a grimdark, arthurian, tactical roleplaying game. Players take on the role of Paladins, cursed knights devoted to the Order of the Ring. The land of Awoudan is encased in shadow and filled with horrid beasts. If it will one day have a bright future, you will not live to see it.
