## Sequence

A combat encounter is a series of rounds and turns. In a round, every character takes one turn. A round represents about six seconds in the fiction, but they can technically be shorter or longer. Time is simulated poorly, do not perform Newtonian analysis of combat. On your turn, you can take a standard action, a move action, and choose to perform additional stamina actions.

The full combat sequence is as follows:

1. **Determine surprise.** The GM determines if any characters are surprised. This may involve any check they wish as there is no perception skill. If the players are attempting to surprise, they could make a stealth check with **DEX**. If they're the ones who may be surprised, they could roll **INT** to piece together that the location is perfect for an ambush. But most of the time, the surprising party will succeed at surprising their targets.

2. **Determine positions.** This game requires a battle map or mat made up of squares. The GM determines the starting positions of every character, but they may ask questions or allow the players to place themselves, within reason. For example, the GM could ask at this stage where each player would have stepped to when they entered a new room.

3. **Roll initiative.** To determine the order of turns, characters roll initiative. This is a d12 + **DEX**. Characters take turns in order from highest to lowest results (tie in favor of players). Players may not change their initiative slot once combat begins.

4. **Surprise round.** If there are surprised characters, they cannot take a turn in the first round of combat and they cannot perform reactions. Every non-surprised character takes their turns as normal.

5. **Take turns.** Every character can take turns in the round now. Use the initiative order to determine who acts until all the characters on one side are dead/disabled or one side flees or otherwise ends the combat.

## Actions

### Types

- **Standard:** An attack or key action.
- **Move:** Move a number of squares equal to your speed or shift one square (shifting prevents opportunity attacks).
- **Free:** A small, easy action such as speaking a sentence, dropping an item, or inspecting something you see. Does not require spending stamina.
- **Stamina:** Any additional action performed on a turn. Requires spending stamina.
- **Reaction:** A special stamina action performed outside of a turn that is limited to once per round.
- **Rest:** Perform no actions except free actions. Recover 2d4 stamina.
- **Concentration**: Certain effects must be maintained by sacrificing a number of **WIL** equal to the rating of concentration per turn as a free action.

### Stamina Actions

- **Attack (6 STA):** Perform an additional melee, ranged, or spell attack action.
- **Move (6 STA):** Perform an additional move action. A maximum of two move actions can be performed per round.
- **Opportunity Attack (3 STA, Reaction):** When you are wielding a melee weapon and an adjacent enemy moves to a square that is not adjacent to you, you may perform an opportunity attack. This is a standard attack action. Certain class abilities grant you additional attacks or triggers for opportunity attacks.
- **Dodge (6 STA, Reaction):** As a reaction to an attack against you, but before damage is rolled, you may dodge. Roll d6 + **DEX** and subtract the sum from the final attack roll. If the sum is zero or less, no on-hit or on-damage effects trigger.
- **Shield (Variable STA, Reaction):** Requires wielding a shield. As a reaction to an attack against you, but before damage is rolled, you may shield. If you do, you must spend a number of **STA** equal to the damage of the attack. If this leaves you with 0 or less **STA**, you are exposed and cannot make a save for this condition on your next turn. ex: Attack roll of 8 when you have 4 armor would result in 4 damage, requiring you to spend 4 **STA** to negate all damage.

## Attacks

When you attack with magic or a weapon, you roll dice and add ability scores or bonuses. The sum is reduced by a relevant defense stat and the result is the damage. If the damage is 0 or less, then the attack is a miss, otherwise it's a hit. If an ability says it deals damage instead of an attack, then there is no attack roll.

## Damage

You have three stats that represent your well-being: health (**HEA**), stamina (**STA**), and willpower (**WIL**). Each of these stats can be damaged and reduced to zero or lower. When that happens, you gain conditions such as exposed, dazed, or unconscious.

### Health Damage

When your **HEA** falls to zero or lower, you are dying. You gain the unconscious condition. You cannot save from this condition. Instead, you perform one death save on your turn. If you fail three death saves, you die. If you succeed on three death saves, you stabilize. A death save is a **VIT** check. Keep track of your death saves as you roll.

If your **HEA** is restored to a value greater than 0, you lose the unconscious condition and your death saves are thrown out.

### Stamina Damage

When your **STA** falls to zero or lower, your stamina is drained. You gain the exposed condition. You cannot save for this condition. At the end of your next turn, you lose the condition and regain d8 + **END** stamina.

## Conditions

- **Bleeding:** At the start of your turn, you take an amount of damage equal to the rating of the bleeding condition. Make a **VIT** save to remove the condition.
- **Burning:** At the start of your turn, you take an amount of damage equal to the rating of the burning condition. Make a **DEX** save to remove the condition.
- **Dying:** You must make three death saves to stabilize and lose the dying condition. If you reach three failed death saves, you die.
- **Exposed:** Unable to perform actions besides free actions, including stamina actions and reactions. You also suffer an additional +4 damage from all attacks until the condition leaves you. Make a **MIN** save to remove the condition.
- **Dazed:** You are unable to perform stamina actions. Make a **MIN** save to remove the condition.
- **Frightened:** You are unable to move towards or attack the creature/object frightening you. Make a **SPI** save to remove the condition.
- **Immobilized:** You are unable to perform move actions or any action that results in you moving from your current square. Make a **VIT** save to remove the condition.
- **Prone:** You move at a quarter speed. Melee attacks against you have +4 and ranged attacks have -4. It takes half your movement to go prone or stand up from prone.
- **Slowed:** Your speed is halved. Make a **VIT** save to remove the condition.
- **Unconscious:** Unaware and unable to perform actions. When first given this condition from a wound, you are dying and must make death saves. This condition can only be removed through healing or medicine from an ally.

## Ranges

### Blast

### Burst

### Close Burst

### Line

### Wall

## Niche Rules

### Concentration

When you are concentrating on an effect and you take damage, you must make a **MIN** check and subtract the amount of damage you sustained from the roll. If you fail, the effect ends.

### Dual Wielding

When you hold two of the same weapon type, one in each hand, you are dual wielding. While you dual wield, you do not add your ability scores to attack rolls, but you can roll two attack rolls as one standard attack action or you can combine both attack rolls into one.

Ex: If you dual wield shortswords, you can either roll d6 against two adjacent targets or roll 2d6 against one adjacent target. If you roll against two targets and hit both, then you can trigger two on-hit effects.

### Stamina Regeneration

At the end of your turn, if you did not spend any **STA**, you regain a number of **STA** equal to d4 + **END**. This cannot decrease your **STA**.

### Willpower Regeneration

At the end of your turn, if you did not spend any **WIL**, you regain a number of **WIL** equal to your **MIN**. This cannot decrease your **WIL**.
