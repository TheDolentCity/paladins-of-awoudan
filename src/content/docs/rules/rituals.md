## Secret Passage

You discover a secret passageway in a natural formation such as a tree or boulder that leads to another natural formation up to 100 squares away. You and allies can enter this passageway, but it remains unnoticed to anyone who has not seen someone enter it. The passageway persists forever.

## Storm

Summon a great storm of gale force winds and rain (or snow). The storm has a range of 1 mile. The storm creates huge waves over water, floods the nearby lowlands after one hour, and disappears after 1 + d4 hours. While the storm is active, at the start of every character in the storm's turn, the wind pushes them d6 squares in a random direction (d8 â†’ 1:N, 2:NE, 3:E, 4:SE, 5:S, 6:SW, 7:W, 8:NW). You are not affected by the spell and you may designate a number of targets up to your **DEX** that you can see, who are not affected by the wind.

## Wall of Force

Create a wall of force using your spell attack range with a number of sections equal to 8 + **INT** + **MIN**. The wall is up to 10 squares tall and appears like a cloud of fog, blocking line of sight. The wall has 1000 **HEA** and attacks against **STA** or **WIL** deal **HEA** damage to it. If the wall is destroyed, each section explodes outward and deals 5d10 damage in a blast 8 facing away from where you cast it (this does not damage other sections of the wall). Characters only take 5d10 even if they are within multiple blasts of the wall.
