- **Stamina:** A pool of energy that can be spent to perform additional actions.
- **Health:** A pool of energy that decreases as your body is attacked.
- **Willpower:** A pool of energy that decreases as your mind is attacked. It can also be spent to perform abilities.

## Action Types

- **Standard:** An attack or key action.
- **Move:** Move a number of squares equal to your speed or shift one square (shifting prevents opportunity attacks).
- **Free:** A small, easy action such as speaking a sentence, dropping an item, or inspecting something you see. Does not require spending stamina.
- **Stamina:** Any additional action performed on a turn. Requires spending stamina.
- **Reaction:** A special stamina action performed outside of a turn that is limited to once per round.
- **Rest:** Perform no actions except free actions. Recover 2d4 stamina.

## Stamina Actions

- **Attack (6 STA):** Perform an additional melee or ranged attack action.
- **Move (6 STA):** Perform an additional move action.
- **Opportunity Attack (2 STA, Reaction):** When you are wielding a melee weapon and an enemy moves to a square that is not adjacent to you, you may perform an opportunity attack. This is a standard attack action. Certain class abilities grant you additional attacks or triggers for opportunity attacks.
- **Dodge (6 STA, Reaction):** As a reaction to an attack against you, but before damage is rolled, you may dodge. Roll d6 + DEX and subtract the sum from the final attack roll. If the sum is zero or less, no on-hit or on-damage effects trigger.
- **Shield (Variable STA, Reaction):** Requires wielding a shield. As a reaction to an attack against you, but before damage is rolled, you may shield. If you do, you must spend a number of stamina equal to the damage of the attack. If this leaves you with 0 or less stamina, you are exposed. ex: Attack roll of 8 when you have 4 armor would result in 4 damage, requiring you to spend 4 stamina to negate all damage.

## Conditions

- **Bleeding:** At the start of your turn, you take an amount of damage equal to the rating of the bleeding condition.
- **Exposed:** Unable to perform actions, including stamina actions and reactions. You also suffer an additional +4 damage from all attacks until the condition leaves you.
- **Dazed:** You are unable to perform stamina actions.
- **Immobilized:** You are unable to perform move actions or any action that results in you moving from your current square.
- **Slowed:** Your speed is halved, rounded down.
- **Unconscious:** Unaware and unable to perform actions. When first given this condition from a wound, you are dying and must make death saves.
