## Checks

The majority of checks have a difficulty of six that you must roll over. You roll a d12 and add the relevant ability score.

### Skills

If you have a relevant skill, you may "burn" it to add +4 to the check. Once a skill is burned in this manner, it cannot be used until you have a long rest.
