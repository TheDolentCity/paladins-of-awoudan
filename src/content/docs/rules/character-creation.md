There are eight steps to character creation, but the most impactful are choosing an omen and a class.

## 1. Choose an omen

Omens are dark events surrounding your birth. It is believed that those born under these signs are "blessed" by a Fell God. There are twelve omens, one for each of the Fell Gods. Choose one based on the god or ability, or just roll d12.

1. [The Battlefield Cry](../../omens/the-battlefield-cry): An omen of Sten, god of Truth.
1. [The Black Wolf](../../omens/the-black-wolf): An omen of Tian, god of Beasts.
1. [The Bleeding Mother](../../omens/the-bleeding-mother): An omen of Wode, god of Bloodshed.
1. [The Desolate Home](../../omens/the-desolate-home): An omen of Aflo, god of Fire.
1. [The Eagle Born](../../omens/the-eagle-born): An omen of Hedr, god of Euphoria.
1. [The Flame Kissed](../../omens/the-flame-kissed): An omen of Daen, god of Poetry.
1. [The Frozen Child](../../omens/the-frozen-child): An omen of Svit, god of Pain.
1. [The Inked Fingers](../../omens/the-inked-fingers): An omen of Virr, god of Secrets.
1. [The Red Moon](../../omens/the-red-moon): An omen of Magi, god of Storms.
1. [The Scarred Face](../../omens/the-scarred-face): An omen of Jori, god of Agriculture.
1. [The Scribe Skin](../../omens/the-scribe-skin): An omen of Rygg, god of Writing.
1. [The Stolen Child](../../omens/the-stolen-child): An omen of Ormu, god of Betrayal.

## 2. Choose a class

There are five roles that affect how a class functions in a skirmish: striker, blaster, controller, leader, and defender. Each role provides an important function to a combat and a well-balanced party will try to fill each role, but a classic party of four will lack in some areas.

### Strikers

Strikers specialize in dealing lots of damage to a single target at a time. They are offensive characters who rely on movement to position themselves in the perfect place to strike their intended target. Strikers are at their best when they are isolated from most combatants.

- Berserker (primary role)
- Ranger (primary or secondary role)
- Arbiter (secondary role)
- Elementalist (secondary role)
- Titan (secondary role)

### Blasters

Blasters specialize in attacks that target large areas or multiple enemies at once. They are offensive characters, but they deal less damage to individual targets than strikers. Blasters are at their best when someone can group up targets for them.

- Elementalist (primary role)
- Ranger (primary or secondary role)
- Berserker (secondary role)

### Controller

Controllers specialize in attacks that control the behavior of enemies or apply debuffs. They favor powers that force movement, prevent enemy attacks from hitting, or apply debilitating conditions. Controllers are at their best when they are not threatened by melee combatants.

- Magus (primary role)
- Elementalist (secondary role)
- Titan (secondary role)

### Leader

Leaders specialize in healing allies and supporting them with buffs. They favor powers that restore defensive stats like stamina, willpower, and luster. Leaders are at their best when allies are close by to receive bonuses from them.

- Divine (primary role)
- Arbiter (secondary role)

### Defender

Defenders specialize in front line combat. They have high defenses and make it difficult for enemies to avoid them or attack their allies. Defenders are at their best when enemies are focusing on them versus other combatants.

- Arbiter (primary role)
- Titan (primary role)
- Divine (secondary role)

### Classes

Each class has a primary and at least one secondary role. Keep that in mind when forming a party. There are 6 total:

- [Arbiter](../../classes/the-arbiter)
- [Berserker](../../classes/the-berserker)
- [Divine](../../classes/the-divine)
- [Elementalist](../../classes/the-elementalist)
- [Magus](../../classes/the-magus)
- [Ranger](../../classes/the-ranger)
- [Titan](../../classes/the-titan)

## 3. Choose ability scores

Choose one of the following ability score arrays and assign each number to one of your ability scores.

- [+4, +3, +2, +1, +0, +0, -1, -2]
- [+3, +3, +2, +1, +1, +0, -1, -1]
- [+3, +2, +2, +2, +0, +0, +0, -1]
- [+3, +2, +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1]
- [+2, +2, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +0]

#### Example:

**STR:** +3 **DEX:** +2 **END:** +1 **VIT:** +1 <br />
**ARC:** -2 **SPI:** -1 **INT:** +0 **MIN:** +0

## 4. Choose gear

Each class has a gear section where you can choose between several items. Look at the existing builds and if one sounds fun, select the associated items. Equipment details can be found [here](../equipment).

## 5. Choose class features

Each class has several features that determine the core behavior of your class in combat. Most classes have you choose features, but some classes the features are fixed and you choose from several options within them instead. For example, some classes have cantrips, small but useful spells and they may choose from a few options at first level.

## 6. Choose a feat

Every character starts with one feat. There are class specific feats, but there are also generic feats. Many class feats will boost specific features so keep that in mind when choosing class features.

## 7. Determine stats and skills

Every character starts with the following stats.

- **You start with 4 encumbrance**. Increase it by 2 for each point of strength.
- **You start with 4 speed**. Increase it by 1 for each point of dexterity.
- **You start with 8 stamina**. Increase it by 4 for each point of endurance.
- **You start with 8 health**. Increase it by 2 for each point of vitality.
- **You start with 8 willpower**. Increase it by 1 for each point of intelligence and 2 for each point of mind.
- **You start with 8 luster**. Increase it by 1 for each point of arcane and 2 for each point of spirit.

Every character starts with 1 skill (even if you have negative **INT**). You start with an additional skill for each positive point of **INT**. Skills can technically be anything, but should be the most specific form of the stated skill. "Combat" is not a skill, but "Fencing" is.

If you have the martial practice feat, you can learn a new martial practice whenever you would gain a skill instead.

## 8. Create Heraldry

Every paladin has a unique title that they are known by. This can be whatever you would like, but if you want inspiration roll three times on the table associated with your class below to get a symbol, it's color, and the color of the background. Typically heraldry is painted on a shield, but if you lack one, then it would be painted somewhere on your surcoat, armor, or robes.

Once you have your heraldry, come up with a title based on it. If you were a ranger and your heraldry was black arrows on a red background, they may call you the Paladin of the Dark Arrow.
