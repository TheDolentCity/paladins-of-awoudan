## 3. Choose ability scores

- [+3, +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1, -2]
- [+2, +2, +2, +0, +0, +0, -1, -1]
- [+2, +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, +0, -1]
- [+1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +0, +0, +0]

#### Example:

**STR:** +3 **DEX:** +2 **END:** +1 **VIT:** +1 <br />
**ARC:** -2 **SPI:** -1 **INT:** +0 **MIN:** +0

## 4. Update ability scores

Update your ability scores based on your omen and class. Each class gets +1 to four different ability scores. Remember, your ability score is a maximum of +5.

## 5. Choose gear

Each class has a gear section where you can choose between several items. Look at the existing builds and if one sounds fun, select the associated items. Equipment lists can be found [here](../equipment).

## 6. Choose class features

Each class has several features that determine the core behavior of your class in combat. Most classes have you choose features, but some classes the features are fixed, but you choose from several options within them. For example, some classes have cantrips, small but useful spells and they may choose from a few options at first level.

## 7. Choose a feat

Every character starts with one feat. There are class specific feats, but there are also generic feats. Many class feats will boost specific features so keep that in mind when choosing class features.
