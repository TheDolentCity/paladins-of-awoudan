## Steps

- [Roll an omen]()
- [Choose a class]()

## 1. Roll an omen

## 2. Choose a class

There are five roles that affect how a class functions in a skirmish: striker, blaster, controller, leader, and defender. Each role provides an important function to a combat and a well-balanced party will try to fill each role, but a classic party of four will lack in some areas.

### Strikers

Strikers specialize in dealing lots of damage to a single target at a time. They are offensive characters who rely on movement to position themselves in the perfect place to strike their intended target. Strikers are at their best when they are isolated from most combatants.

- Paladin of the Umber Trees (primary role)
- Paladin of the Red Wood (primary or secondary role)
- Paladin of the Azure Mountain (secondary role)
- Paladin of the Sable Spire (secondary role)

### Blasters

Blasters specialize in attacks that target large areas or multiple enemies at once. They are offensive characters, but they deal less damage to individual targets than strikers. Blasters are at their best when someone can group up targets for them.

- Paladin of the Sable Spire (primary role)
- Paladin of the Red Wood (primary or secondary role)
- Paladin of the Celadon Tower (secondary role)
- Paladin of the Umber Trees (secondary role)

### Controller

Controllers specialize in attacks that control the behavior of enemies or apply debuffs. They favor powers that force movement, prevent enemy attacks from hitting, or apply debilitating conditions. Controllers are at their best when they are not threatened by melee combatants.

- Paladin of the Celadon Tower (primary role)
- Paladin of the Azure Mountain (secondary role)
- Paladin of the Sable Spire (secondary role)

### Leader

Leaders specialize in healing allies and supporting them with buffs. They favor powers that restore defensive stats like stamina, willpower, and luster. Leaders are at their best when allies are close by to receive bonuses from them.

- Paladin of the White Ash Temple (primary role)
- Paladin of the Celadon Tower (secondary role)

### Defender

Defenders specialize in front line combat. They have high defenses and make it difficult for enemies to avoid them or attack their allies. Defenders are at their best when enemies are focusing on them versus other combatants.

- Paladin of the Azure Mountain (primary role)
- Paladin of the White Ash Temple (secondary role)

### Classes

Each class has a primary and at least one secondary role. Keep that in mind when forming a party. There are 5 total:

- [Paladin of the Azure Mountain](../../classes/the-azure-mountain)
- [Paladin of the Celadon Tower](../../classes/the-celadon-tower)
- [Paladin of the Red Wood](../../classes/the-red-wood)
- [Paladin of the Sable Spire](../../classes/the-sable-spire)
- [Paladin of the Umber Trees](../../classes/the-umber-trees)
- [Paladin of the White Ash](../../classes/the-white-ash)

#### Become a Paladin of the Azure Mountain if...

- ...you want to defend your allies with your shield and sword
- ...you want to be a master of a variety of melee weapons
- ...you want to survive devastating attacks like dragon fire

#### Become a Paladin of the Celadon Tower if...

- ...you want to cast useful cantrips all the time
- ...you want to control the battlefield with magic
- ...you want to overpower a single foe's mind

#### Become a Paladin of the Red Wood if...

- ...you want to take down a powerful foe with bleeding arrows
- ...you want to strike many foes with hails of arrows
- ...you want to focus on positioning yourself for maximum damage

#### Become a Paladin of the Sable Spire if...

- ...you want to destroy many foes with blasts of magic
- ...you want to master spells of fire, vines, or ice
- ...you don't fear losing control of your soul

#### Become a Paladin of the Umber Trees if...

- ...you want to inflict precise wounds on strong foes
- ...you want to strike out at multiple enemies with powerful melee attacks
- ...you want to move with ease across a battlefield

#### Become a Paladin of the White Ash if...

- ...you want to heal the bodies and minds of your allies
- ...you want to create great shields and defenses using magic
- ...you want to repel umbral creatures with holy attacks

## 3. Choose ability scores

Choose one of the following ability score arrays and assign each number to one of your ability scores.

- [+4, +3, +2, +1, +0, +0, -1, -2]
- [+3, +3, +2, +1, +1, +0, -1, -1]
- [+3, +2, +2, +2, +0, +0, +0, -1]
- [+3, +2, +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1]
- [+2, +2, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +0]

#### Example:

**STR:** +3 **DEX:** +2 **END:** +1 **VIT:** +1 <br />
**ARC:** -2 **SPI:** -1 **INT:** +0 **MIN:** +0

## 4. Choose gear

Each class has a gear section where you can choose between several items. Look at the existing builds and if one sounds fun, select the associated items. Equipment details can be found [here](../equipment).

## 5. Choose class features

Each class has several features that determine the core behavior of your class in combat. Most classes have you choose features, but some classes the features are fixed and you choose from several options within them instead. For example, some classes have cantrips, small but useful spells and they may choose from a few options at first level.

## 6. Choose a feat

Every character starts with one feat. There are class specific feats, but there are also generic feats. Many class feats will boost specific features so keep that in mind when choosing class features.

- [+3, +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1, -2]
- [+2, +2, +2, +0, +0, +0, -1, -1]
- [+2, +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, +0, -1]
- [+1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +0, +0, +0]
