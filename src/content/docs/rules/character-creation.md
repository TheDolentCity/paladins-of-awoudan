description: The rules to follow to create a character.
---

There are seven steps to character creation.

## 1. Roll or choose an omen

## 2. Choose a class

There are five roles that affect how a class functions in a skirmish: striker, blaster, controller, leader, and defender. Each role provides an important function to a combat and a well-balanced party will try to fill each role, but a classic party of four will lack in some areas.

### Strikers

Strikers specialize in dealing lots of damage to a single target at a time. They are offensive characters who rely on movement to position themselves in the perfect place to strike their intended target. Strikers are at their best when they are isolated from most combatants.

- Warhawk (primary role)
- Ranger (primary or secondary role)
- Titan (secondary role)
- Elementalist (secondary role)

### Blasters

Blasters specialize in attacks that target large areas or multiple enemies at once. They are offensive characters, but they deal less damage to individual targets than strikers. Blasters are at their best when someone can group up targets for them.

- Elementalist (primary role)
- Ranger (primary or secondary role)
- Warhawk (secondary role)

### Controller

Controllers specialize in attacks that control the behavior of enemies or apply debuffs. They favor powers that force movement, prevent enemy attacks from hitting, or apply debilitating conditions. Controllers are at their best when they are not threatened by melee combatants.

- Magus (primary role)
- Titan (secondary role)
- Elementalist (secondary role)

### Leader

Leaders specialize in healing allies and supporting them with buffs. They favor powers that restore defensive stats like stamina, willpower, and luster. Leaders are at their best when allies are close by to receive bonuses from them.

- Divine (primary role)

### Defender

Defenders specialize in front line combat. They have high defenses and make it difficult for enemies to avoid them or attack their allies. Defenders are at their best when enemies are focusing on them versus other combatants.

- Titan (primary role)
- Divine (secondary role)

### Classes

Each class has a primary and at least one secondary role. Keep that in mind when forming a party. There are 6 total:

- [Divine](../../classes/the-divine)
- [Elementalist](../../classes/the-elementalist)
- [Magus](../../classes/the-magus)
- [Ranger](../../classes/the-ranger)
- [Titan](../../classes/the-titan)
- [Warhawk](../../classes/the-warhawk)

#### Become a Divine if...

- ...you want to heal the bodies and minds of your allies
- ...you want to create great shields and defenses using magic
- ...you want to repel umbral creatures with holy attacks

#### Become a Elementalist if...

- ...you want to destroy many foes with blasts of magic
- ...you want to master spells of fire, ice, or sparks
- ...you are willing to risk your soul for powerful magic

#### Become a Magus if...

- ...you want to cast useful cantrips or powerful rituals
- ...you want to manipulate the entire battlefield with magic
- ...you want to overpower a single foe's mind

#### Become a Ranger if...

- ...you want to take down a powerful foe with bleeding effects
- ...you want to strike many foes with hails of arrows
- ...you want to position yourself for maximum damage

#### Become a Titan if...

- ...you want to protect your allies with your armor and shield
- ...you want to hold the front line of combat by yourself
- ...you want to knock down enemies with heavy weapons

#### Become a Warhawk if...

- ...you want to inflict precise wounds on strong foes
- ...you want to strike multiple enemies with melee attacks
- ...you want to move with ease across a battlefield

## 3. Choose ability scores

Choose one of the following ability score arrays and assign each number to one of your ability scores.

- [+4, +3, +2, +1, +0, +0, -1, -2]
- [+3, +3, +2, +1, +1, +0, -1, -1]
- [+3, +2, +2, +2, +0, +0, +0, -1]
- [+3, +2, +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1]
- [+2, +2, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +0]

#### Example:

**STR:** +3 **DEX:** +2 **END:** +1 **VIT:** +1 <br />
**ARC:** -2 **SPI:** -1 **INT:** +0 **MIN:** +0

## 4. Choose gear

Each class has a gear section where you can choose between several items. Look at the existing builds and if one sounds fun, select the associated items. Equipment details can be found [here](../equipment).

## 5. Choose class features

Each class has several features that determine the core behavior of your class in combat. Most classes have you choose features, but some classes the features are fixed and you choose from several options within them instead. For example, some classes have cantrips, small but useful spells and they may choose from a few options at first level.

## 6. Choose a feat

Every character starts with one feat. There are class specific feats, but there are also generic feats. Many class feats will boost specific features so keep that in mind when choosing class features.

## 7. Determine stats and skills

Every character starts with the following stats.

- **You start with 4 encumbrance**. Increase it by 1 for each point of strength.
- **You start with 4 speed**. Increase it by 1 for each point of dexterity.
- **You start with 8 stamina**. Increase it by 4 for each point of endurance.
- **You start with 8 health**. Increase it by 2 for each point of vitality.
- **You start with 8 willpower**. Increase it by 1 for each point of intelligence and 2 for each point of mind.
- **You start with 8 luster**. Increase it by 1 for each point of arcane and 2 for each point of spirit.

Every character starts with 1 skill (even if you have negative **INT**). You start with an additional skill for each positive point of **INT**. Skills can technically be anything, but should be the most specific form of the stated skill. "Combat" is not a skill, but "Fencing" is.
