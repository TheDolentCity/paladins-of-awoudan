description: An overview of foes and rules for running them.

"Foe" is a generic term to refer to human and creature enemies in the game. These could be monstrous beings like dragons or simple antagonists like roadside bandits.

## Roles

Every foe has at least one role. These determine the foe's function in a combat while hinting at the abilities and attacks it likely possesses.

### Artillery

Artillery foes excel at ranged combat. These foes launch volleys of arrows, sorcerous lightning, and other ranged attacks from a safe distance. They are vulnerable in melee and are oftentimes protected by brutes and soldiers.

### Brute

Brute foes excel at melee combat and usually have high health. They move slowly and have lower defenses, but deal high damage if you get close. They are vulnerable to ranged and magic attacks.

### Controller

Controller foes excel at manipulating the battlefield with forced movement, debuffs, and unique penalties. They stay close to brutes and soldiers, but usually get closer than artillery since their attacks and abilities don't have long range.

### Lurker

Lurker foes excel at hiding from sight and striking at the right time for high damage. They usually have some ability that helps them disappear from the battlefield and reappear on a later turn as they attack.

### Skirmisher

Skirmisher foes excel at mobility and positioning. 

### Soldier

Soldier foes excel at melee combat and have high defenses.

## Special Roles

Any foe can have a special role in addition to their base role.

### Boss

A boss is the toughest foe. They always have special free actions that make them far more difficult to fight. For example, dragons have lair actions that can cause things like falling stalactites to harm the players. Most bosses are designed to fight solo, but some rely on minions or other foes to be included.

### Elite

An elite is a tougher foe. They can be thought of as a mini-boss. It does not modify how you run them, but it is advised to only have one elite max per encounter.

### Leader

A leader is a foe with some ability that buffs or heals their allies. It does not modify how you run them, but it is advised to only have one leader max per encounter.

### Minion

A minion has no health, stamina, or willpower. They are defeated quickly, but there are often many of them.

- If it takes health damage, it is slain.
- If it takes stamina damage, it falls unconscious.
- If it takes willpower damage, it flees the skirmish.
