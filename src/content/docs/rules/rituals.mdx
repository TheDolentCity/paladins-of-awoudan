To learn rituals, you must have the ritualist feat.

Rituals are powerful magical effects that require intense study to master. Each ritual has a level, ability score, casting time, duration, and components. To perform a ritual, the character must retain focus for the continuous casting time, expend the components, and then make a check using the relevant ability score. On a success, the ritual's effect takes place.

The maximum number of rituals you can perform in a day is equal to your **INT**. You are unable to perform rituals if your **INT** is 0 or lower. If you attempt a ritual, whether it is successful or not, you must wait at least an hour before you can attempt that same ritual again.

- [Divination](./#divination): Rituals for finding information.

- [Summoning](./#summoning): Rituals for commanding nature and creatures.
- [Travel](./#travel): Rituals for magical transportation.
- [Warding](./#warding): Rituals for protection.

## Divination

If the wall is destroyed, each section explodes outward and deals 5d10 damage in a blast 8 facing away from where you cast it (this does not damage other sections of the wall). Characters only take 5d10 even if they are within multiple blasts of the wall.

**Failure:** You take 1d10 damage and are knocked prone.
