## Weapons

Most weapons are only effective at one or two damage types. The most common is piercing, followed by slashing, then crushing. Piercing is the only damage type that bows deal, making it common for ranged units. Most melee weapons excel at slashing. A few heavy and blunt melee weapons, such as maces, have excellent crushing attacks that rely on strength as opposed to dexterity.
