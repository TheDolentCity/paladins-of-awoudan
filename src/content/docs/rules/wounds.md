## Wounds

If your **HEA** falls to zero or lower, you roll a d12 + injury level on the relevant wounds table. Your injury level is equal to the rating of the highest wound you're currently suffering from. You then reset your **HEA** to its maximum.

### Blunt Wounds

These wounds are often caused by melee and kinetic weapons. They often involve physically moving the Paladin and breaking their bones.
