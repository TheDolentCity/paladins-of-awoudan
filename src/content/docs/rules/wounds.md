## Wounds

If your **HEA** falls to zero or lower, you roll a d12 + injury level (INJ) on the relevant wounds table (based on the type of damage suffered). Your injury level is equal to the rating of the highest wound you're currently suffering from, or 0 if you have no wounds. After you suffer a wound, you reset your **HEA** to its maximum.

### Crush Wounds

These wounds are often caused by blunt melee weapons such as maces or powerful monsters. They often involve moving the Paladin, breaking their bones, and conditions that cannot be saved against. For those special conditions, the wound itself must be healed for the condition to disappear.
