- **Alert:** You have +4 to any check to avoid being surprised. Additionally, when an skirmish begins and before rolling initiative, you may spend 3 **WIL** to perform a warning cry. All allies who can hear it may add your **SPI** or **INT** to their initiative checks. You must be aware at the start of the skirmish.
- **Die Hard:** Add +2 to death saves. Once per skirmish when you stabilize after rolling a third successful death save, you may return to consciousness with 1 **HEA**.
- **Energetic:** When you regenerate stamina at the end of your turn, you may roll d12+**END** instead of d4+**END**.
- **Exposing Flank:** When you flank an enemy and gain combat advantage, all your allies gain combat advantage against the target as well.
- **Fearless:** Immune to the frightened condition.
- **Focused Mind:** You add +4 to all concentration checks.
- **Iron Will:** Before you roll a save versus a condition, you may spend a number of **WIL** up to your **INT** or **MIN** (whichever is higher) to add an equal amount to the save roll.
- **Mage Slayer:** When an enemy in melee range makes a magic attack, you may perform an opportunity attack. If the attack deals damage, the spell fails.
- **Second Wind:** Gain access to the second wind action. Once per skirmish, regain 8 **HEA**, 8 **STA**, and 8 **WIL** (up to your maximums) as a free action.
- **Unyielding:** Subtract 2 from all wound rolls.
