There are two main forms of healing, items and resting.

## Items

There are several common healing items that can be used as a standard action on yourself or an adjacent ally. Most restore your base stats.

- **Fulmin Mushrooms:** Enter a rage stance. You gain the benefits of the Berserker Rage feature. If you already have this feature, you gain the normal benefits, but you do not fall out of the rage stance until you are exposed or knocked unconscious.
- **Blue Roses Elixir:** Increase **WIL** by 2d6 + **MIN**.
- **Green Sage Elixir:** Increase **STA** by 2d6 + **END**.
- **Red Willow Elixir:** Remove a condition or increase **HEA** by d6 + **VIT**.
- **Tonic of Regrowth:** Take before a long rest. At the end of the long rest, you may make a save against a wound of any injury level (in addition to the normal free save).
- **Tonic of Unfeeling:** Ignore the effects of a wound for 1 minute.

## Resting

There are two types of resting, short rests and long rests.

### Short Rest

A short rest can be accomplished in 10 minutes of uninterrupted time where you are no longer moving or taking primary action. At the end of this rest, you regain full **HEA**, **STA**, and **WIL**. Additionally, if you were suffering from any conditions not imposed by wounds, you heal them during this time as well.

### Long Rest

A long rest can be accomplished in 8 hours of sleep. You may break this 8 hours up over 12 hours (ex: sleep 6 hours, watch for 4, sleep 2 more hours), but no more than that. At the end of this time you gain the full benefits of a short rest and additionally may make one save against each minor wound you have. Minor wounds are wounds with an injury level less than 12.

Healing severe wounds (injury level of 12 or greater) requires a fell fire, powerful item, magic ability, or a full season of rest.

## Fell Fires

There is significant speculation around where fell fires come from. Some say they are campfires made by the Fell Gods themselves, others say they are blessings, but all anyone can say for sure is that only Omens and powerful magi can see them.

Fell fires are found in places of importance or power: cairns, standing stones, sea caves, etc. They are almost always outside as most creatures feel compelled to avoid them. They appear like a normal campfire, except the flame burns a brilliant blue instead of orange or red.

If you perform a short rest near a fell fire, in addition to the normal benefits, you regain full **LUS**. If you perform a long rest near a fell fire, you regain full **LUS** and you may make one save against 1 severe wound.
