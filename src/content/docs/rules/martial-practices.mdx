To learn martial practices, you must have the martial practice feat.

Martial practices are potent skills that require specialized training. Each martial practice has a level, ability score requirements, execution time, and duration. To perform a martial practice, the character must retain focus for the continuous execution time and potentially make a check using the relevant ability score.

Most martial practices have the effect automatically occur, but some modify the effect based on the results of a check.
