import Aside from "../../../components/markdown/Aside.astro";

The majority of checks have a difficulty of 6 that you must roll over. You roll a d12 and add the relevant ability score.

## Opposed Checks

When you roll an opposed check, you subtract the target's same ability score from the roll.

<Aside type="example">
If you had +4 **STR** and the target had +2 **STR** and you made an opposed strength check as part of a grapple check and rolled a 4, you would add +4 and subtract -2, for a total of 6. This would be a failure.

## Saves

A save is a check that removes a condition or prevents you from receiving a condition. All saves are rolled at the start of your turn, before the effect takes place. Certain saves, such as saves for wounds, require expending a resource, time, or a magic item in order to roll them.

## Skills

If you have a relevant skill, you may "burn" it to add +4 to the check. Once a skill is burned in this manner, it cannot be used until you have a long rest.

## Advantage

Some checks might have advantage. In that case, roll 2d12 and take the highest die.

## Disadvantage

Some checks might have disadvantage. In that case, roll 2d12 and take the lowest die.
