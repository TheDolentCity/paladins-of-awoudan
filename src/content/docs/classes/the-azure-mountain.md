When you take a level in this class after level one, increase your health by 4, stamina by 2, willpower by 1, and luster by 1.

### Level 1

Every Paladin of the Azure Keep has a marking, defensive, and protective feature. Choose one option for each feature type:

- **Mountain's Mark:** Marking targets makes allies harder to hit.
  - **Ironclad Mark:** As a free action once per round, you may mark a number of creatures up to your **VIT** that are in a close burst 1. While a target is marked, it has a -2 penalty to attack rolls that do not include you as a target. Each mark persists until the end of the encounter.
  - **Shield Banger's Mark:** You must wield a shield to benefit from this feature. As a free action once per round, you may bang your shield and mark a number of targets up to your **END** that are in a close burst 6. While a target is marked, it has a -2 penalty to attack rolls that do not include you as a target. This mark lasts until the start of your next turn.
  - **Titan's Mark:** As a free action once per round when you attack, whether it hits or not, you may mark 1 of the targets involved in the attack. Marked targets have a penalty to attack rolls that do not include you as a target. If you are wielding a two-handed weapon, the penalty is equal to your **STR** (minimum -2) otherwise the penalty is -2. This mark lasts until the end of your next turn.
- **Mountain's Protection:** You were trained to survive the hardest fighting.
  - **Ironclad Onslaught:** You must wear heavy armor to benefit from this feature. Once per round as a free action when you make an attack, whether the attack hits or not, you may roll a d4 afterwards. On a 1, you may push the target 1 square. On a 2, you may slide the target 1 square. On a 3, you may knock the target prone. On a 4, you regain **HEA** equal to your **VIT**. Alternatively, if you are grappling someone, you may spend this free action to deal damage to them equal to your **STR**.
  - **Shield Defense:** You must wield a shield to benefit from this feature. You decrease the cost of the shield action by your **END** and **VIT**.
  - **Titan's Invigorating Blows:** You must wield a two-handed weapon to benefit from this feature. When you wound or kill an enemy, you regain an amount of **HEA** equal to your **STR**.
- **Mountain's Defense:** You protect allies that stay close to you.
  - **Ironclad Monolith:** You must wear heavy armor to benefit from this feature. All attacks against allies in close burst 1 have -2 to attack rolls, regardless of whether or not the attacker is marked.
  - **Shield Warden:** You must wield a shield to benefit from this feature. When an ally in close burst 1 is attacked, you may use the shield reaction to redirect the attack to yourself instead. You still perform the shield reaction as normal.
  - **Titan's Ferocity:** You must wield a two-handed weapon to benefit from this feature. When you wound or kill a target, every enemy in a close burst 2 gains the frightened condition.

### Level 2

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 3

Learn 3 of the following attack attributes. You can apply 1 attribute to a standard attack or 2 attributes at the cost of 6 **WIL**. You cannot apply more than 2 attributes to one attack.

- **Bash:** Requires a shield. Add +d4 to the attack roll. If the attack hits, the target is pushed 1 square and you can choose to shift into the square it left behind.
- **Cleave:** Requires a two-handed weapon. If the attack hits, a creature in a close burst 1 of the target takes damage equal to your **STR** or **DEX**.
- **Focus:** If the attack misses, regain 2 **WIL** and **STA**.
- **Grapple:** Requires a free hand. If the attack hits, the target is grappled by you.
- **Hack and Slash:** If the attack misses, the target takes damage equal to your **STR**.
- **Halt:** Requires this attack to be a reaction. If the attack hits and the target is moving, you immediately end their move action.
- **Knockdown:** Requires a two-handed weapon. If the attack hits, the target is knocked prone.
- **Unstoppable:** Requires you have a wound. Add your **VIT** to the attack roll.

### Level 4

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 5

Take one of the following daily attacks:

- **Ironclad Grasp:** Requires heavy armor. Make a melee attack. On a hit or miss, the target is grappled. They must be your size or smaller to grapple them in this manner. This specific grappled condition cannot be saved against. It only ends when you choose to end it as a free action, or you suffer a wound, unconsciousness, or death. If the grappled condition ends because the target is killed, you regain use of this ability, but you cannot use it again this encounter.
- **Shield Sundering:** Requires a shield. Can only be performed as a free action when you use the shield reaction. Instead of the normal shield effect, your shield is destroyed. The target of the attack loses no **HEA**, **STA**, or **WIL**, there is no on-hit effect, and the attacker is knocked prone and exposed.
- **Titan's Roar:** Requires a two-handed weapon. Can only be performed as a reaction when you wound or kill a target. You let out a terrifying bellow in a close burst 8. Every enemy in the burst takes **WIL** damage equal to d6 + your **STR** and gains the frightened condition.

## Feats

You must have at least one level in this class to take the following feats:

- **Artillery Training:** Requires a shield. Increase the pierce penalty by -3 when you are targeted by ranged weapons.
- **Inspiring Momentum:** When you push, slide, or knock a target prone, you regain 1 **WIL** and 1 **STA**.
- **Opportunistic Fighter:** Decrease the cost of opportunity attacks to 1 **STA**. You also have no restriction on a number of opportunity attacks you can perform in one round.
- **Peerless Defender:** When an enemy shifts in order to avoid an opportunity attack from you, it still triggers opportunity attacks.
- **Relentless Titan:** Requires the titan's mark feature. Add **END** to melee attacks against targets you have marked.
- **Seize The High Ground:** Requires a two-handed weapon. When you attack a target that is prone, you can add your **STR** to the attack roll, even if it is already applied.
- **Shield Deflection:** Requires a shield. When you use the shield action against a melee attack and the attacker misses, you may slide the attacker 1 square or knock them prone. This only works if the attacker is your size or smaller and in a close burst 1 of the target.
- **Titan's Opportunity:** Requires a two-handed weapon. You may perform opportunity attacks when an ally is attacked by a target you have marked and you are within melee range of the attacker.
- **Unmovable:** Requires heavy armor. You reduce all forced movement (push, pull, etc.) by 2. You can gain the slowed condition, but it has no effect on you. If you gain the immobilized condition, you treat it as the slowed condition.
- **Wrestler's Tutelage:** When you grapple a creature, you may move at your full speed and the creature has a -2 penalty to any checks to break free.
