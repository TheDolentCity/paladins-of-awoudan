## Features

The Ranger class has access to the ranger study feature, ranger's twin strike feature, offensive feature, and ranged attack feature.

### Ranger Study

You start with the Martial Practice and Martial Practice (study) feats for free.

### Ranger's Twin Strike

The first time on your turn that you would spend **STA** to make an extra attack, you instead spend 0 **STA**. This feature also lets you attack twice in a round with a longbow, even though it has the slow property.

### Offensive Options

- **Eagle Strike:** Whenever you make a ranged attack, you may choose to make it a sky strike. The attack must target a single unoccupied square, but do not make the attack roll yet. If any creature enters that square before the start of your next turn, make the attack roll against them. If the attack hits and the target was performing an action, it ends the action immediately. You may make multiple sky strikes per turn.
- **Guardian's Overwatch:** At the start of your turn, as a free action, you may enter or leave the overwatch stance. Until the stance ends, you cannot move on your turn, but you may perform opportunity attacks on any target that enters or leaves a burst 3 zone centered on you. You may perform additional opportunity attacks in one round using this ability at the cost of 3 **STA**, but may not perform them multiple times on the same target.
- **Hunter's Prey:** Once per turn as a free action, you may designate the enemy creature closest to you as your prey. Once per round, when an attack you make hits your prey, you may add d6+**INT** to the damage. The hunter's prey status remains active until the prey is defeated. You may only have one prey at a time.

### Ranged Attack Options

**Each of these ranged attack attributes requires a bow.** You can apply 1 attribute to a standard ranged attack or 2 attributes at the cost of 6 **WIL**. You cannot apply more than 2 attributes to one attack.

- **Accurate:** Add +4 to the attack roll, but subtract 6 from the final damage (to a minimum of 1).
- **Bleed:** If the attack hits, the target gains the bleeding 2 condition.
- **Break:** If the attack hits, the target gains the broken condition.
- **Burst:** Spend 6 **WIL** to add this attribute. The attack becomes burst 1 with the same range.
- **Close Quarters:** Must target an adjacent enemy. The attack does not trigger an opportunity attack. If the attack hits, you may push the target 2 squares.
- **Evasive:** After the attack, shift 3 squares.
- **Line:** Spend 6 **WIL** to add this attribute. The attack's range becomes line 6.
- **Pin:** If the attack hits, the target gains the slowed condition. If the target already has the slowed condition, they gain the immobilized condition instead.
- **Sniper:** Double the range of the attack.

## Feats

You must have at least one level in this class to take the following feats:

- **Arterial Wounding:** When you inflict the bleeding condition on an enemy, they also gain the greater bleeding condition. While the condition is active, the target suffers one point of damage for each square they move, voluntarily or involuntarily. This damage cannot be reduced or increased. The condition ends when the original bleeding condition ends.
- **Attentive:** You cannot be surprised. Allies in a close burst 3 add +2 to their initiative checks.
- **Bloody Hunter:** Requires the hunter's prey feature. If you hit your hunter's prey with an attack and inflict the bleeding condition, add your **INT** to the rating of the bleeding condition.
- **Critical Wounds:** Targets have -4 on saves against any conditions you inflict.
- **Deadly Wounds:** Targets add your **INT** to their wound rolls.
- **Expert Archer:** Spend **STA** instead of **WIL** to add the burst or line ranged attack attributes to an attack.
- **Improved Overwatch:** You must have the guardian's overwatch feature in order to take this feat. Increase the zone of guardian's overwatch to a burst 4.
- **Lightfoot:** You ignore difficult terrain.
- **Lightfoot (improved):** You must have the lightfoot feat in order to take this feat. Your swim and climb speed is equal to your running speed.
- **Lithebow's Training:** When you attack while wielding a shortbow and deal damage, you can shift one square.
- **Martial Training:** Learn two more ranged attack attributes.
- **Precision Archer:** Add +**DEX** to the attack rolls with a bow or longbow.
- **Rampage:** Requires the hunter's prey feature. If you kill your prey, regain 6 **STA** and 6 **WIL**.
- **Ranger's Defense:** You can dual wield a parrying dagger and throwing dagger and you add your ability scores to the attack rolls when you do so. Additionally while dual wielding them, you can treat them as having Parry 4.
- **Ranger's Offense:** When you attack a surprised creature, add +d12 to the attack roll.
- **Sidestep:** You gain access to the sidestep reaction. When a creature makes a melee attack against you, you may spend 12 **STA** to sidestep. Immediately shift 1 square. The attack roll can still be made if you remain within melee range, otherwise it is a miss.
- **Strongbow's Training:** When you attack while wielding any bow and deal damage, you can push the target 1 square.
