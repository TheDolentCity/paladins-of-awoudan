## Features

The Arbiter class has access to the arbiter's oath feature, blessing feature, cantrip feature, and melee/spell attack attributes feature.

### Arbiter's Oath Options

As a free action once per round, you may swear a divine oath against one foe in a close burst 5. You cannot use this ability again until the target flees the skirmish, surrenders, or is killed. While the oath is active, the target is marked and has a -4 penalty to attack rolls that do not include you as a target. You must engage the target on your turn. If you make an attack against the target or end your turn adjacent to them, then you have successfully engaged the target. If the oath is broken, you cannot use this feature again until the end of the skirmish. Additionally, select one one of the benefits below:

- **Oath of Command:** Allies in close burst 1 gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls. One ally you can see can make an opportunity attack whenever the target of your oath makes an attack against an ally in close burst 4 of you.
- **Oath of Sanctuary:** Allies in close burst 1 gain a +1 bonus to **DEF**. You can make an opportunity attack against the target of your oath whenever they make an attack that does not include you.
- **Oath of Vengeance:** Gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls for each ally in close burst 1. You can make an opportunity attack against the target of your oath whenever they make an attack that includes you.

### Arbiter's Spellfighting

Arbiters are able to fight effectively with melee weapons and holy spells. Normally, casting a cantrip or spell is a standard action, but the first cantrip or spell you perform on your turn you can perform as a free action.

### Cantrip Options

Each Arbiter cantrip requires a holy symbol.

- **Divine Bell:** As a standard action, you conjure the sound of a tolling bell. It drowns out all nearby noise that is not at least as loud. Creatures unaware that you cast a cantrip must make a **SPI** save or become frightened.
- **Divine Compulsion:** As a standard action, touch one creature. The creature makes a **MIN** save. If it fails, choose one of the following effects:
  - The creature must tell you its greatest fear.
  - The creature must tell you its greatest desire.
  - The creature must tell you a truthful answer to one question.
- **Divine Light:** As a standard action, your holy symbol sheds bright light in a close burst 5 and dim light in a close burst 10. This effect lasts for one minute.
- **Divine Summons:** As a standard action, you request a nearby lesser god head your words. They *must* listen, but do not have to appear. If you are true and loyal, they may help you, but the gods are very fickle and hate to be summoned. Their answer is never silence nor speech.

### Melee Attack Options

You can only apply one attribute to a standard melee attack.

- **Guidance:** If the attack hits, one ally in close burst 2 gains a bonus to attack rolls against the target equal to your **SPI**.
- **Indomitable:** If this attack deals a wound or kills the target, you regain 6 **WIL**.
- **Maneuver:** If the attack hits, you choose one ally in close burst 5 to immediately perform a move action as a free action or every ally in close burst 5 can immediately shift 1 square as a free action.
- **Pursuit:** If the target of the attack moves away from you before the start of your next turn, you can shift a number of squares equal to your **DEX** as a free action after they have completed their move.
- **Smite:** Before you roll the attack, you may spend **WIL** to add an equal amount to the attack roll. There is no upper limit on how much **WIL** you can spend when you do this. If you spend all of your **WIL**, your will is broken and you automatically gain the unconscious condition. You can only apply this attack attribute to one attack per round.

### Spell Options

Each spell is a standard action that requires a holy symbol and costs **WIL** to perform. You cannot perform the same spell twice in one round.

- **Blessing of Flame:** Costs 2 **WIL**. You imbue one of your weapons with this blessing. Your weapon sheds bright light in your square and dim light in adjacent squares and when you hit foes with this weapon they gain the burning (4) condition. Your weapon can only have one blessing at a time. Concentration (1).
- **Blessing of Light:** Costs 2 **WIL**. You imbue one of your weapons with this blessing. Your weapon sheds bright light in your square and dim light in adjacent squares and gains the Holy property. Your weapon can only have one blessing at a time. Concentration (1).

Your weapon can only have one blessing at a time. Concentration (1).
- **Blessing of Vigor:** Costs 2 **WIL**. You imbue one of your weapons with this blessing. Whenever you hit a foe with a melee attack with this weapon, one ally in close burst 2 regains **HEA** equal to your **SPI**. Your weapon can only have one blessing at a time. Concentration (1).
- **Bulwark:** Costs 6 **WIL**. All allies in close burst 2 gain a bonus to **DEF** and **FOC** equal to your **SPI** until the start of your next turn.
- **Radiance:** Costs 6 **WIL**. Use the range of your holy symbol and create a burst 3 zone of bright light. Adjacent squares have dim light. Allies in the zone have a cumulative +1 **DEF** bonus for each adjacent ally. Concentration (1).
- **Sanction:** Costs 2 **WIL**. A spell attack. If the attack hits and the target moves before the start of your next turn, they take **HEA** damage equal to your **SPI**+**MIN**.
- **Tether:** Costs 2 **WIL**. A spell attack. If the attack hits, you pull the target a number of squares up to your **SPI**+2. They stop moving if they enter a square adjacent to you. Until the start of your next turn, the target cannot move further than 2 squares away from you.
