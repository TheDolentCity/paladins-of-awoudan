## Features

The Arbiter class has access to the arbiter's oath feature, blessing feature, cantrip feature, and melee/spell attack attributes feature.

### Arbiter's Oath Options

As a free action once per round, you may swear a divine oath against one foe in a close burst 5. You cannot use this ability again until the target flees the skirmish, surrenders, or is killed. While the oath is active, the target is marked and has a -4 penalty to attack rolls that do not include you as a target. You must engage the target on your turn. If you make an attack against the target or end your turn adjacent to them, then you have successfully engaged the target. If the oath is broken, you cannot use this feature again until the end of the skirmish. Additionally, select one one of the benefits below:

- **Oath of Command:** One ally you can see can make an opportunity attack whenever the target of your oath makes an attack against an ally in close burst 4 of you.
- **Oath of Sanctuary:** You can make an opportunity attack against the target of your oath whenever they make an attack that does not include you.
- **Oath of Vengeance:** You can make an opportunity attack against the target of your oath whenever they make an attack that includes you.

### Blessing Options

- **Blessing of the Flame:** Your holy symbol was blessed by a lesser god of flame. When you hit an enemy with your holy symbol, you pull them a number of squares up to your **SPI**+2. They stop moving if they move adjacent to you. Additionally, you have access to the sanction attack attribute.
- **Blessing of the River:** Your armor was blessed by a lesser god of rivers. When you shift while wearing armor, you may shift a number of squares equal to your **SPI** instead of the normal 1. This is not reduced by armor speed penalties. Additionally, you have access to the maneuver attack attribute.
- **Blessing of the Wind:** Your weapon was blessed by a lesser god of winds. You do not suffer any penalty to throwing the weapon and treat the range as equal to your **SPI**+2. You can also apply melee attack attributes from this class when you throw your weapon in this manner. As a free action once per round, the weapon can return to your hand. If it is restrained, you must make an opposed **SPI** check to have it return to your hand. Additionally, you have access to the smite attack attribute.

### Cantrip Options

Each Divine cantrip requires a holy symbol.

- **Divine Light:** As a standard action, your holy symbol sheds bright light in a close burst 5 and dim light in a close burst 10. This effect lasts for one minute.
- **Divine Miracle:** As a standard action, perform the divine miracle associated with the Fell God that blessed you.
  - **Aflo's Miracle:** You light a source of fuel on fire within 100 feet with the flick of your wrist. If the fire is fed, it will burn hot enough to melt steel.
  - **Daen's Miracle:** Your touch cleans soiled clothes. If you touch them in water, you may change the color they are dyed.
  - **Hedr's Miracle:** You touch a glass or skin of water and turn it into wine.
  - **Jori's Miracle:** Plants flourish and grow somewhat under your touch. This effect fades over several days, but it can restore plants near-death back to life.
  - **Magi's Miracle:** You can change the direction of the wind. Lasts for 1 minute.
  - **Ormu's Miracle:** You can speak to and command nearby snakes. Commands last for 1 hour.
  - **Rygg's Miracle:** You can understand any language. Lasts for 1 minute.
  - **Sten's Miracle:** You can detect if anyone here has broken an oath. Lasts for 1 minute.
  - **Svit's Miracle:** Your touch causes a creature to not feel any pain. Lasts for 1 minute.
  - **Tian's Miracle:** With a howl, you can summon the nearby wolves of the land. They are not friendly or helpful, nor antagonistic or aggressive. They are not yours to command. How long before they arrive depends on how far you are from the wilds.
  - **Virr's Miracle:** You gain the unconscious condition (save ends). During that unconscious bout, you see a vague image or hear a strange riddle that is prophetic in nature. It hints at, but does not reveal, your future.
  - **Wode's Miracle:** You can enter a terrifying, frenzied state. The first time anyone sees you after you enter this state, they must make a **SPI** check or gain the frightened condition. Lasts for 1 minute.
- **Divine Summons:** As a standard action, you request a nearby lesser god head your words. They *must* listen, but do not have to appear. If you are true and loyal, they may help you, bu the gods are very fickle and hate to be summoned. Their answer is never silence nor speech.
- **Divine Weapon:** As a standard action, imbue one weapon you touch with a holy essence. The weapon gains the Holy property. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

### Attack Options

The Arbiter class has access to both melee and spell attack attributes. Each attribute will specify if it requires a melee weapon or a holy symbol.

You can apply one attribute to a standard attack or apply two at the cost of 3 **WIL**. You cannot apply more than two attributes to one attack.

- **Burst:** This attribute can only be applied to attacks with a holy symbol. The attack becomes a close burst 2 and does not target allies.
- **Guidance:** This attribute can only be applied to attacks with a holy symbol. If the attack hits, allies gain a bonus to attack rolls against the target equal to your **SPI**.
- **Holy:** This attribute can only be applied to attacks with a melee weapon. Treat the weapon as though it has the holy property.
- **Indomitable:** This attribute can be applied to attacks with a melee weapon and holy symbol. If this attack deals a wound or breaks a target's will, regain 6 **WIL**.
- **Light:** This attribute can only be applied to attacks with a holy symbol. Every square in the attack leaves behind bright light. Adjacent squares have dim light. The light fades at the end of your next turn.
- **Maneuver:** Requires the blessing of the river. This attribute can be applied to attacks with a melee weapon and holy symbol. If the attack hits, you choose one ally in close burst 5 to immediately perform a move action as a free action or every ally in close burst 5 can immediately shift 1 square as a free action.
- **Pursuit:** This attribute can only be applied to attacks with a melee weapon. If the target of the attack moves away from you before the start of your next turn, you can perform a shift action as a free action after they have completed their move.
- **Rebuke:** This attribute can be applied to attacks with a melee weapon and holy symbol. If this attack wounds, kills, or breaks a target's will, every foe in a close burst 1 of them gains the frightened condition.
- **Revitalize:** This attribute can only be applied to attacks with a holy symbol. If this attack breaks a target's will, one ally who can see regains **HEA** equal to your **SPI**.
- **Sanction:** Requires the blessing of the flame. This attribute can be applied to attacks with a melee weapon and holy symbol. If the attack hits and the target moves before the start of your next turn, they take **HEA** damage equal to your **SPI**+**MIN**.
- **Smite:** Requires the blessing of the wind. This attribute can only be applied to attacks with a melee weapon. Before you roll the attack, you may spend **WIL** to add an equal amount to the attack roll. There is no upper limit on how much **WIL** you can spend when you do this. If you spend all of your **WIL**, your will is broken and you automatically gain the unconscious condition.
