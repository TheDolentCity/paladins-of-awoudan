Once per round, when an attack you make deals damage to your quarry, you may add d6+**INT** to the damage roll. The hunter's quarry remains active until the quarry is defeated. You may only have one quarry at a time.
- **Guardian's Overwatch:** At the start of your turn, as a free action, you may enter or leave the Guardian stance. Until the stance ends, you cannot move on your turn, but you may perform opportunity attacks on any target that enters or leaves a burst 3 zone centered on you. You may perform multiple opportunity attacks in one round using this ability, but may not perform them multiple times on the same target.

- **Hail of Arrows**: This attack requires a bow. Choose a burst 1 square within range of your weapon. Increase the size of the burst by +1 (up to a max of 4) for every 6 points of **STA** you spend. Perform a standard attack action. The attack is applied to every creature in the burst.
