When you take a level in this class after level one, increase your health by 2, stamina by 0, willpower by 2, and luster by 4.

### Level 1

All Paladins of the Sable Spire have the same three features: inner light, cantrips, and sorcery. Choose one cantrip. Each sorcery spell you cast you must choose a custom range and attack type.

- **Inner Light:**
  - **Brighten:** As a standard action once per round, spend 2 **WIL** to regain 1 **LUS**. You may spend as much **WIL** as you want. You cannot use this feature two turns in a row.
  - **Innate Caster:** You do not need a magic implement to cast spells, you only need one free hand. When you cast spells in this manner, treat your attack roll as d6 + **ARC**, your range as 6 + **ARC**, and attacks have the magic property.
- **Cantrips:** Weak, but useful spells.
  - **Sorcerer's Healing:** As a standard action, touch a dying character. They are shocked and stabilized, but remain unconscious.
  - **Sorcerer's Light:** As a standard action, conjure a ball of fire that follows you. It sheds light exactly as a torch does. It lasts for one hour or fades when you take damage.
  - **Sorcerer's Wind:** As a standard action, conjure a gust of wind. This gust can originate from anywhere you can see and pushes in a blast 2. It is strong enough to push a 50 lb object 1 square.
  - **Touch of Flame:** As a standard action, conjure a handful of flame in your hand. This creates bright light in a close burst 1 and provides modest warmth. Your hand lights objects aflame.
  - **Touch of Frost:** As a standard action, conjure clean water in your hand from the air. You can also touch a square of water and freeze it or touch a frozen object you can hold and thaw it.
  - **Touch of Sparks:** As a standard action, conjure sparks in your hand. Your touch shocks and spreads through water or metal. Additionally, you may attract light metal objects to your hand or repel light metal objects from your hand. This effect lasts for one minute.
- **Sorcery:** Powerful attack spells that you can cast as a standard action. Choose a range and attack type.
  - **Range**: Use default spell attack range or use one of the below instead.
    - **Area:** The range is the same except instead of a single target it hits in a burst 1. Increase the size by 1 for every 2 **LUS** you spend.
    - **Blast:** The range becomes blast 2. Increase the size by 1 for every 2 **LUS** you spend.
    - **Burst:** The range becomes close burst 2. Increase the size by 1 for every 2 **LUS** you spend.
    - **Line:** The range becomes line 6. Increase the size by 2 for every 2 **LUS** you spend.
  - **Attack**: Use one of the below attack types for your attack. Each one targets **HEA** instead of **STA** or **WIL**.
    - **Flame:** Attack with d4 + **ARC**. Spend 6 **WIL** to treat the attack roll as d8.
    - **Frost:** Attack with d4 + **ARC**. Spend 6 **WIL** to treat the attack roll as d8.
    - **Sparks:** Attack with d4 + **ARC**. Spend 6 **WIL** to treat the attack roll as d8.

### Level 2

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 3

Learn one more cantrip and all sorcery spell attributes.

**Sorcery Attributes:** When you cast a sorcery spell, spend 2 **LUS** to add one of these attributes. You can add a max number of attributes equal to your **MIN**.

- **Flame Attributes:** Require the flame attack type.
  - **Combust:** Requires a single target. Add d6 + **SPI** to the attack. If the attack inflicts a wound, add your **SPI** to the wound roll.
  - **Fireball:** Requires burst range. Increase the burst by 2 and add your **SPI** to the attack roll.
  - **Lingering Flames:** The attack leaves behind a zone on each targeted square. If any character enters a square in the zone, they take d4 damage.
- **Frost Attributes:** Require the frost attack type.
  - **Cold Winds:** Requires close burst or blast range. Increase the range by 4. The attack only deals damage to **STA**. If this attack drains a target's **STA**, they gain the immobilized condition in addition to exposed.
  - **Deep-Freeze:** Requires a single target. Add d6 + **END** to the attack. If the attack inflicts a wound, the target gains the immobilized condition, otherwise they gain the slowed condition.
  - **Glacier:** Each unoccupied square of the attack is populated by a small iceberg. It does not block line of sight, but provides cover and blocks movement. Each glacier has 1 **HEA** and is immune to **STA** or **WIL** damage.
  - **Lingering Chill:** The attack leaves behind a zone on each targeted square. If any character enters the zone, they gain the slowed condition. If they already have the slowed condition, they gain the immobilized condition.
- **Spark Attributes:** Require the spark attack type.
  - **Chain:** Requires a single target. Add d6 + **DEX** to the attack roll. If the attack wounds or kills the target, the attack jumps to a target up to **DEX** squares away and deals **DEX** damage. The attack continues to jump in this manner, whether it wounds/kills or not, a number of times up to your **DEX**.
  - **Overcharge:** If the attack wounds a target, they take d8 + **ARC** damage to **WIL** as well.
  - **Pillar:** Requires targeting a single unoccupied square. A pillar of sparks appears in the square. Any time a character enters a square within close burst 2 of the pillar, they automatically take an amount of damage equal to your **DEX**. This is not a reaction.
  - **Thunder:** The attack pushes the targets a number of squares equal to your **ARC** and deafens them until the end of their next turn.
  - **Wave:** Requires blast range. Increase the blast by 2 and add your **DEX** to the attack roll.

### Level 4

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 5

Take one of the following daily attacks:

- **Incinerate:** As a standard action, choose one target you can see. They take d8 + **ARC** damage without an attack roll. This counts as flame damage. If the target gains the burning condition, add d6 + **ARC** to the rating.
- **Lightning Serpent:** As a standard action, conjure a serpent of lightning in an unoccupied square. Concentration (2). As a free action on your turn, you can move the lightning serpent a number of squares up to your **ARC** + **DEX**. It can pass through occupied squares and if it does, it deals damage equal to your **ARC** + **DEX** to the creature occupying it. This counts as sparks damage. It cannot pass through the same square twice in one round. You do not need line of sight to control the lightning serpent.
- **Wall of Ice**: As a standard action, create a wall of ice using your spell attack range with a number of sections equal to 6 + **END**. Concentration (2). Each section of the wall has 50 **HEA** and is immune to **STA** and **WIL** attacks. The wall is 2 squares tall and blocks line of sight. Characters gain the slowed condition if they enter a square adjacent to the wall and take d4 + **END** damage for each adjacent square they travel through. This counts as frost damage. If a character starts their turn next to the wall, they gain the immobilized condition.
