### Level 1

Take 1 of the following red wood hunting features and 3 martial practices:

- **Martial Hunting:** You were trained to kill in the violent woods of Awouden.
  - **Hunter's Prey:** Once per turn, as a free action, you may designate the enemy creature closest to you as your prey. Once per round, when an attack you make deals damage to your prey, you may add d6+**INT** to the damage. The hunter's prey status remains active until the prey is defeated. You may only have one prey at a time.
  - **Overwatch:** At the start of your turn, as a free action, you may enter or leave the overwatch stance. Until the stance ends, you cannot move on your turn, but you may perform opportunity attacks on any target that enters or leaves a burst 3 zone centered on you. You may perform additional opportunity attacks in one round using this ability at the cost of 3 **STA**, but may not perform them multiple times on the same target.
  - **Ranger's Patience:** On your turn as a free action, you may sacrifice your move action to benefit from this feature. You are unable to move as part of any actions on this turn as well. When you sacrifice your movement in this way, all bow attacks deal double damage. Attack rolls remain unchanged. If you rolled d6+3 and got a 6 for a total of 9 piercing, and the target has -4 pierce defense, then you would deal 10 damage to them.
- **Martial Practices:** Useful techniques warriors learn.
  - **Courier's Training:**: You can spend ten minutes stretching and breathing before a run. If you do so, you can run without stopping for a time. Make an **END** check. On success, you can run for 24 hours without stopping. On failure, you can run for 12 hours without stopping.
  - **Feign Death:** You slow your heartbeat and breathing to be imperceptible to creatures. You appear unconscious, but are aware of your surroundings. You can emerge from this state as a free action. Creatures have -4 to checks to avoid being surprised by this.
  - **Patrol:**: You can spend one hour to patrol the nearby area in a 1 mile radius. At the end of the exploration, you know the locations of any buildings, ruins, natural formations, bodies of water, or suitable campsites. You also detect the presence of any inhabitants and whether or not they are hostile to you. You have +4 to avoid triggering an skirmish while you are on patrol in this manner.
  - **Silent Speech:**: You can communicate via pantomime. Your sentences cannot be longer than three words or communicate abstract concepts such as love, but any creature can understand simple dialog like asking where an animal went, coordinating when to move or attack, or asking where fresh water is.
  - **Survivor's Trade:**: You can find suitable or construct suitable shelter to survive in the wild given an hour of light to do so. It may not be comfortable, but it can survive even the harshest weather.
  - **Tame Beast**: Using your voice and hands, you are able to tame a non-hostile, non-human creature. If it is an animal that can be ridden, it will allow you to mount it. It will listen to your commands as long as they do not put it in danger. If you succeed on **SPI** or **INT** checks, it will follow a dangerous command.
  - **Tracker:**: You can examine tracks left by a creature or creature(s). You can tell what type of creature left the tracks, their numbers, the direction they're heading. Make an **INT** check. On success, you can also tell their pace, if they're wounded, and what they are transporting with them.
  - **Thief's Guile:**: You hide a small object that weighs no more than 5 lbs on your person or in a structure. It cannot be found unless its container (cloak, wall, cart, etc.) is destroyed.
  - **Weather Vane:**: By examining the sky for 1 minute, you can predict what weather changes will occur (if any) up to 20 miles away and when the weather will change.

### Level 2

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 3

Learn 3 of the following attack attributes. You can apply 1 attribute to a standard attack or 2 attributes at the cost of 3 **WIL**. You cannot apply more than 2 attributes to one attack.

- **Burst:** Requires a bow. Spend 6 **WIL** to add this attribute. The attack becomes burst 1 with the same range.
- **Close Quarters:** Requires a bow and must target an adjacent enemy. The attack does not trigger an opportunity attack. If the attack deals damage, you may push the target 2 squares.
- **Critical:** If the attack deals damage, the target gains the bleeding condition with a rating equal to your **INT**.
- **Focus:** If the attack misses, regain 2 **WIL** and **STA**.
- **Line:** Requires a bow. Spend 6 **WIL** to add this attribute. The attack's range becomes line 6.
- **Pin:** Requires a bow. The target gains the slowed condition. If the target already has the slowed condition, they gain the immobilized condition instead.
- **Sky Strike:** Requires a bow. The attack must be against a single unoccupied square. If any creature enters that square before the start of your next turn, make the attack roll against them. If the attack hits, it ends the target's move action.

### Level 4

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 5

Take one of the following daily attacks:

- **Thrill of the Hunt**: Perform a standard attack action and add **INT** to the attack roll, even if it is already applied. If the attack kills the target, then your **STA** returns to full and you regain the use of this ability, but you cannot use the ability again this skirmish.
- **Hail of Arrows**: This attack requires a bow. Attack as many targets as you wish in a close burst 4. Increase the size of the burst by +1 (up to a max of 6) for every 6 points of **STA** you spend. Perform a separate attack roll for each target.
- **Trueshot Volley**: This attack requires a bow and that you do not move on your turn. Double the effective range of your bow. Perform 4 attacks as one standard attack action without spending **STA**. These attacks must all have the same target. If the target is killed and you have attacks remaining, you may choose a different target.

## Feats

You must have at least one level in this class to take the following feats:

- **Arterial Wounding:** When you inflict the bleeding condition on an enemy, they also gain the greater bleeding condition. While the condition is active, the target suffers one point of damage for each square they move, voluntarily or involuntarily. This damage cannot be reduced or increased. The condition ends when the original bleeding condition ends.
- **Attentive:** You cannot be surprised. Allies in a close burst 3 add +2 to their initiative checks.
- **Critical Wounds:** Targets have -4 on saves against any conditions you inflict.
- **Deadly Wounds:** Targets add your **INT** to their wound rolls.
- **Eagle Sight:** You must have the overwatch feature in order to take this feat. Increase the zone of overwatch to a burst 4.
- **Eagle Sight (improved):** You must have the eagle sight feat in order to take this feat. Increase the zone of overwatch to a burst 5.
- **Lightfoot:** You ignore difficult terrain.
- **Lightfoot (improved):** You must have the lightfoot feat in order to take this feat. Your swim and climb speed is equal to your running speed.
- **Lithebow's Training:** When you attack while wielding a shortbow and deal damage, you can shift one square.
- **Martial Study:** You can take 3 more martial practices.
- **Martial Training:** Requires learning attack attributes. Learn two more attack attributes.
- **Precision Archer:** Add +**DEX** to the range and attack rolls with a bow or longbow.
- **Rampage:** Requires the hunter's prey feature. If you kill your prey, regain 4 **STA** and 4 **WIL**.
- **Ranger's Defense:** When you dual wield the ranger's long knife and short knife, you can add your ability scores to the attack rolls. Additionally while dual wielding them, you can add your **STR** and **DEX** instead of just **DEX** when you perform the parry action.
- **Ranger's Offense:** When you attack a surprised creature, add +d12 to the attack roll.
- **Sidestep:** You gain access to the sidestep reaction. When a creature makes a melee attack against you, you may spend 12 **STA** to sidestep. Immediately shift 1 square. The attack roll can still be made if you remain within melee range, otherwise it is a miss.
- **Strongbow's Training:** When you attack while wielding any bow and deal damage, you can push the target 1 square.
- **Twin Strike:** When you attack, you can roll two separate attack rolls, but you cannot add your ability scores. Both attack rolls count as separate attacks and trigger on-miss or on-hit effects separately. The attacks may be against different targets. Whatever attack attributes you apply are applied to both attacks. If there is a cost to this, you must suffer it twice.
