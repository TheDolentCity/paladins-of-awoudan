## Features

The Elementalist class has access to the inner light feature, innate caster feature, sorcery feature, sorcery spell feature, and cantrip feature.

### Inner Light

As a standard action once per round, spend 2 **WIL** to regain 1 **LUS**. You may spend as much **WIL** as you want. You cannot use this feature two turns in a row.

### Innate Caster

You do not need a magic implement to cast spells, you only need one free hand. When you cast spells in this manner, treat your attack roll as d4 + **ARC**, your range as 6 + **ARC**, and attacks have the magic property.

### Sorcery

Powerful attack spells that you can cast as a standard action. Choose a range and attack type.

- **Range**: Use default spell attack range or use one of the below instead.
  - **Area:** The range is the same except instead of a single target it hits in a burst 1. Increase the size by 1 for every 2 **LUS** you spend.
  - **Blast:** The range becomes blast 1. Increase the size by 1 for every 2 **LUS** you spend.
  - **Burst:** The range becomes close burst 1. Increase the size by 1 for every 2 **LUS** you spend.
  - **Line:** The range becomes line 6. Increase the size by 3 for every 2 **LUS** you spend.
- **Attack**: Use one of the below attack types for your attack.
  - **Flame:** Targets **HEA**. Attack with d4 + **ARC**. Spend 6 **WIL** to add your **SPI** to the attack roll.
  - **Frost:** Targets **HEA**. Attack with d4 + **ARC**. Spend 6 **WIL** to add your **END** to the attack roll.
  - **Sparks:** Targets **HEA**. Attack with d4 + **ARC**. Spend 6 **WIL** to add your **DEX** to the attack roll.

  - **Psychic:** Targets **WIL**. Attack with d10 + **ARC**. Spend 6 **WIL** to add your **MIN** to the attack roll.

### Sorcery Spell Options

Each sorcery spell is a standard action that costs **LUS** to perform.

- **Flame Spells:**
  - **Combust:** Costs 2 **LUS**. Flame spell attack. Add your **SPI** to the attack roll. If the attack inflicts a wound, add your **SPI** to the wound roll.
  - **Fireball:** Costs 6 **LUS**. Flame spell attack. The attack's range is burst 3 (same base range). Add your **SPI** to the attack roll.
  - **Rain of Fire:** Costs 4 **LUS**. Flame spell. Choose a number of squares in your sorcery spell range equal to your **SPI**. Fire rains down on these squares until the start of your next turn. Any character that starts their turn in the square, or enters the square, takes d4 damage.
- **Frost Spells:**
  - **Cold Winds:** Costs 2 **LUS**. Frost spell attack. The attack's range is cost burst 4. The attack only deals damage to **STA**. This attack leaves behind a zone that lasts 4 rounds, disappearing at the end of your 4th turn from now. If any character enters the zone, they gain the slowed condition. If they already have the slowed condition, they gain the immobilized condition. If they start their turn in the zone with the slowed condition, they lose it and gain the immobilized condition instead.
  - **Deep-Freeze:** Costs 2 **LUS**. Frost spell attack. Add your **END** to the attack roll. If this attack drains a target's **STA**, they gain the immobilized condition in addition to exposed, but cannot save the immobilized condition until after the exposed condition fades.
  - **Glacier:** Costs 4 **LUS**. Frost spell. The spell's range is blast 3. Each unoccupied square of the attack is populated by a small iceberg. It blocks line of sight, provides cover, and obstructs movement. Each glacier has 1 **HEA** and is immune to **STA** or **WIL** damage.
- **Spark Spells:**
  - **Chain:** Costs 2 **LUS**. Spark spell attack. If the attack wounds or kills the target, the attack jumps to a new target that the original target could see up to **DEX** squares away and deals **DEX** damage. If that attack wounds or kills, it jumps again following the same rules. This attack cannot hit the same target twice and it can only jump in this manner a number of times up to your **DEX**.
  - **Pillar:** Costs 2 **LUS**. Spark spell. Target a single unoccupied square. A pillar of sparks appears in the square, but does not block movement. Any time a character enters the square the pillar occupies, they take damage equal to **ARC** + **DEX**. Any time a character enters a square within close burst 2 of the pillar, they automatically take an amount of damage equal to your **DEX**. Neither attack consumes a reaction. The pillar lasts 2 rounds, disappearing at the end of your 2nd turn from now.
  - **Thunderwave:** Costs 6 **LUS**. Spark spell attack. The attack's range is blast 3. Add your **DEX** to the attack roll. Anyone hit by the attack is pushed a number of squares equal to your **ARC** and they gain the deafened condition.
- **Force Spells:**
  - **Slam:** Costs 2 **LUS**. Force spell attack. If it hits, push or pull the target a number of squares equal to your **STR**.
- **Psychic Spells:**
  - **Flay:** Costs 2 **LUS**. Psychic spell attack. If it hits, slide the target a number of squares equal to your **MIN**.

### Cantrip Options

- **Elementalist's Healing:** As a standard action, touch a dying character. They are shocked and stabilized, but remain unconscious.
- **Elementalist's Light:** As a standard action, conjure a ball of fire that follows you. It sheds light exactly as a torch does. It lasts for one hour or fades when you take damage.
- **Elementalist's Wind:** As a standard action, conjure a gust of wind. This gust can originate from anywhere you can see and pushes in a blast 2. It is strong enough to push a 50 lb object 1 square.
- **Touch of Flame:** As a standard action, conjure a handful of flame in your hand. This creates bright light in a close burst 1 and provides modest warmth. Your hand lights objects aflame.
- **Touch of Frost:** As a standard action, conjure clean water in your hand from the air. You can also touch a square's worth of water and freeze it or touch a frozen object you can hold and thaw it.
- **Touch of Sparks:** As a standard action, conjure sparks in your hand. Your touch shocks and spreads through water or metal. Additionally, you may attract light metal objects to your hand or repel light metal objects from your hand. This effect lasts for one minute.
