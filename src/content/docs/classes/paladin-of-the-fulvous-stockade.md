### Level 1

Take 1 of the following red wood hunting features and 3 martial practices:

- **Martial Pursuit:** You were trained to chase down and kill your foes.
  - **Skirmisher's Quarry:** Once per round as a free action, you may designate a target you can see as your quarry. When you have a quarry, once per round as a free action, you may shift a number of squares equal to your **DEX** towards them. The skirmisher's quarry remains active until the quarry is defeated. You may only have one quarry at a time. Additionally, you may add your ability scores to attack rolls when dual wielding.
  - **Raider's Cruelty:** Whenever you wound or kill an enemy, you may immediately perform an additional attack action against any viable target without spending **STA**. You cannot perform a move action before this attack. This effect can trigger multiple times per round.
- **Martial Practices:** Useful techniques warriors learn.
  - **Courier's Training:**: You can spend ten minutes stretching and breathing before a run. If you do so, you can run without stopping for a time. Make an **END** check. On success, you can run for 24 hours without stopping. On failure, you can run for 12 hours without stopping.
  - **Feign Death:** You slow your heartbeat and breathing to be imperceptible to creatures. You appear unconscious, but are aware of your surroundings. You can emerge from this state as a free action. Creatures have -4 to checks to avoid being surprised by this.
  - **Silent Speech:**: You can communicate via pantomime. Your sentences cannot be longer than three words or communicate abstract concepts such as love, but any creature can understand simple dialog like asking where an animal went, coordinating when to move or attack, or asking where fresh water is.
  - **Tame Beast**: Using your voice and hands, you are able to tame a non-hostile, non-human creature. If it is an animal that can be ridden, it will allow you to mount it. It will listen to your commands as long as they do not put it in danger. If you succeed on **SPI** or **INT** checks, it will follow a dangerous command.
  - **Tracker:**: You can examine tracks left by a creature or creature(s). You can tell what type of creature left the tracks, their numbers, the direction they're heading. Make an **INT** check. On success, you can also tell their pace, if they're wounded, and what they are transporting with them.
  - **Thief's Guile:**: You hide a small object that weighs no more than 5 lbs on your person or in a structure. It cannot be found unless its container (cloak, wall, cart, etc.) is destroyed.
  - **Weather Vane:**: By examining the sky for 1 minute, you can predict what weather changes will occur (if any) up to 20 miles away and when the weather will change.

### Level 2

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 3

Learn 2 of the following attack attributes. You can apply 1 attribute to a standard attack or 2 attributes at the cost of 3 **WIL**. You cannot apply more than 2 attributes to one attack.

- **Biter:** Requires a cruel weapon. Increase the rating of cruel by +2.
- **Evasive:** If the attack hits, you may shift a number of squares equal to your **END**.
- **Exhausting:** If the attack hits or misses, the target takes **STA** damage equal to your **END**.
- **Hack and Slash:** If the attack misses, the target takes damage equal to your **DEX**.
- **Nimble:** For the rest of your turn, you do not provoke opportunity attacks.
- **Shatter:** Requires a two-handed weapon. Whether the attack hits or misses, creatures in a close burst 1 of the target besides yourself, take damage equal to your **STR**.

### Level 4

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 5

Take one of the following daily attacks:

- **Invigorating Assault**: As a standard action, shift a number of squares equal to your speed. You may perform an attack action on any target that you move adjacent to during this movement without spending **STA** on extra attacks. You may still choose to spend **STA** for extra attacks. This action does not count as your free move action on your turn.
- **Thrill of the Hunt**: Perform a standard attack action and add **INT** to the attack roll, even if it is already applied. If the attack kills the target, then your **STA** returns to full and you regain the use of this ability, but you cannot use the ability again this skirmish.
- **Hail of Arrows**: This attack requires a bow. Choose a burst 1 square within range of your weapon. Increase the size of the burst by +1 (up to a max of 4) for every 6 points of **STA** you spend. Perform a standard attack action on every creature in the burst.
