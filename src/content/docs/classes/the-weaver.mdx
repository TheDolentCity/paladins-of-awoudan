## Features

The Weaver class has access to the weaver exit feature, weaver rituals feature, weaver shield feature, cantrip feature, and spells feature.

### Weaver Exit

Once per skirmish as a move action, you may move up to your speed and at any point enter a natural object such as a tree or boulder and reappear up to 20 squares away from behind another natural object.

### Weaver Rituals

You start with the Ritualist and Ritualist (study) feats for free.

### Weaver Shield

As a free action on your turn, you may spend 6 **WIL** to gain +8 **DEF**. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

### Cantrip Options

Each Weaver cantrip requires a magical implement.

- **Weaver Light:** As a standard action, shed bright light from your magical implement in a close burst 2 and dim light in a close burst 6. Increase both bursts by 1 for every point of **WIL** you spend. This effect lasts for one minute.
- **Weaver Hand:** As a standard action, you conjure an ethereal hand up to 10 squares away. This hand is the same size as your own. It can carry 1 **ENC** worth of items and move with 5 **SPE**. If it has to make a check, it uses your ability scores. Concentration (1).
- **Weaver Illusion:** As a standard action, you conjure an illusion up to 10 squares away. This illusion cannot be larger than a human. If the illusion is touched it fades instantly. Concentration (1) to keep the same illusion alive.
- **Weaver Sound:** As a standard action, you conjure a sound as quiet as whispering or as loud as shouting up to 10 squares away. The sound may be a creature sound or a nonvocal sound such as a falling rock or wind.

### Spell Options

Each Weaver spell requires a magical implement.

- **Dazzle:** Costs 6 **WIL**. A spell attack. The spell's range is burst 1 within your implement range. Targets hit by the attack gain the dazed or stunned condition (your choice).
- **Dome:** Costs 6 **WIL**. The spell's range is close burst 2. This spell creates a zone. The zone's edge is surrounded by a dome of magic. Ranged and spell attacks stop if they intersect with the dome. The dome has 50 **HEA**. Attacks targeting **STA** or **WIL** deal damage to the dome.
- **Domination:** Costs 6 **WIL**. A spell attack. If the attack breaks the target's will, they gain the domination condition. At the start of the target's turn, as a free action before they roll for saves, you may force them to perform a move or standard action.
- **Hammer:** Costs 6 **WIL**. A spell attack. The spell's range is blast 1. Whether the attack hits the target or not, they are pushed 4 squares.
- **Hysteria:** Costs 6 **WIL**. A spell attack. The spell's range is close burst 2. You slide each target you hit with the attack 2 squares.
- **Overpower:** Costs 6 **WIL**. A spell attack. Add your **INT** and **MIN** to your attack roll. If the attack break's the target's will, they don't roll on the broken will table. Instead they gain the exposed condition.
- **Sigil:** Special cost. Inscribe a magic rune on your square. Describe a spell:. Instead of performing the spell immediately, the spell is stored in the sigil. When any creature enters that square besides you, the described spell is triggered immediately, you spend the **WIL** and perform the spell as a reaction as if you were still there. You may perform this reaction multiple times per round at the cost of 2 **WIL** for each additional reaction. You may only have a number of sigils up to your **INT** active at a time. They last for up to an hour.
- **Sleep:** Costs 12 **WIL**. A spell attack. The spell's range is burst 1 within your implement range. If anyone hit by this spell has their will broken, they do not roll and instead immediately gain the unconscious condition.
- **Wall:** Costs 6 **WIL**. Create a wall using your spell attack range with a number of sections equal to **INT** + **MIN**. The wall is 2 squares tall and appears like a cloud of fog, blocking line of sight. Each section of the wall has 1 **HEA** and attacks against **STA** or **WIL** deal **HEA** damage to it. If a section is destroyed, other portions of the wall remain active. Concentration (1).
- **Web:** Costs 6 **WIL**. The spell's range is burst 3 within your implement range. This spell creates a zone. Anyone who enters the zone or start their turn there gains the slowed condition. If they already have the slowed condition, they gain the immobilized condition instead. Concentration (1).
