## Features

The Berserker class has access to the berserker study feature, berserker's rage feature, primal blessing feature, and melee attack feature.

### Berserker Study

You start with the Martial Practice feat for free.

### Berserker's Rage

You have the ability to enter a rage stance on your turn as a free action. You have a number of rages equal to your **SPI** + your level (minimum 1). You regain 1 rage when you take a short rest and all of your rages when you take a long rest. While in the rage stance, you have the following effects applied:

- You roll **STR** and **DEX** checks with advantage.
- You roll wound rolls for yourself with advantage (taking the lowest injury).
- You ignore the effect of wound conditions with an injury level lower than 7, but still record the condition. If you fall out of a rage and the condition could still apply, then the effect begins on you.
- The maximum number of attacks you can make in a turn is equal to your **SPI** instead of your **END** (minimum 2).
- When you wound or kill a foe with a melee attack, you may immediately perform an additional attack action with the same weapon against any viable target without spending **STA**. You cannot perform a move action before this attack. This effect can trigger multiple times per round.
- You fall out of the stance if you fail to make an attack roll by the end of your turn or if you are dazed, stunned, or exposed. You cannot enter the rage stance if you are dazed, stunned, or exposed.
- You may choose to end your rage when you receive a wound to decrease the severity by -2 (to a minimum of 1).

### Primal Blessing Options

- **Rage of the Bear:** While raging, gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls when you have a wound and gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against a foe that is wounded.
- **Rage of the Hawk:** While raging, gain a +2 bonus to speed and you can shift 3 squares instead of 1.
- **Rage of the Wolf:** While raging, gain a +2 bonus to charge and bull rush attacks and combat advantage grants you a +4 bonus instead of +2.

### Melee Attack Options

You can apply 1 attribute to a standard attack or 2 attributes at the cost of 3 **WIL**. You cannot apply more than 2 attributes to one attack.
 
- **Battering Ram:** Can only be applied to a bull rush. Add +2 to the bull rush check. If the check is successful, increase the amount of squares pushed by +1 and the target takes damage equal to your **STR**.
- **Biter:** Requires a cruel weapon. Increase the rating of cruel by +2. If you gain a wound before the start of your next turn, increase the injury level by +2.
- **Bloody:** If the attack hits or misses, every character in a close burst 1 of the target including yourself gains the bleeding (2) condition.
- **Evasive:** If the attack hits or misses, you may shift a number of squares equal to your **END**.
- **Furious:** If the attack hits, you ignore all damage that targets **WIL** until the start of your next turn. This does not modify spending **WIL** willingly.
- **Hack and Slash:** If you already add your **STR** to the attack roll, also add your **DEX** to the roll and take damage equal to your **DEX** afterwards. If you already add your **DEX** to the attack roll, also add your **STR** and take damage equal to your **STR** afterwards. If the attack roll adds both, then you add nothing.
- **Knockdown:** Requires a two-handed weapon or shield. If the attack hits, the target is knocked prone.
- **Nimble:** If the attack hits, for the rest of your turn, you do not provoke opportunity attacks.
- **Opportunistic:** Requires you have combat advantage. Add +4 to the attack roll and take 2 damage.
- **Shatter:** Requires a two-handed weapon and a single target. Whether the attack hits or misses, creatures in a close burst 1 of the target including yourself, take 2 damage.
- **Shield Bash:** Requires a shield. Add +d4 to the attack roll.
- **Shield Slam:** Requires a shield. If the attack hits, the target is pushed 1 square and you can choose to shift into the square it left behind.
- **Tempest:** Requires a two-handed weapon or dual wielding weapons. The attack's range changes to close burst 1 and you take damage equal to your **STR** or **DEX**, whichever is higher.
- **Throw:** You can throw your melee weapon without the regular penalty. The range is equal to your **STR**.
