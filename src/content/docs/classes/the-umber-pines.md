## Levels

When you take a level in this class after level one, increase your health by 4, stamina by 2, willpower by 2, and luster by 2.

### Level 1

Take the rage feature, 1 martial pursuit, and 2 martial practices:

- **Rage:** You have the ability to enter a rage stance on your turn as a free action. You have a number of rages equal to your **SPI** + your level (minimum 1). You regain 1 rage when you take a short rest and all of your rages when you take a long rest. While in the rage stance, you have the following effects applied:
  - You have combat advantage on all attacks, and all attacks from foes have combat advantage against you.
  - You roll **STR** and **DEX** checks with advantage.
  - You roll wound rolls for yourself with advantage (taking the lowest injury).
  - You may split damage you suffer among your **HEA**, **STA**, and **WIL** stats. Ex: If you had 8 **HEA** and 4 **WIL** and took 6 damage targeting **WIL**, you could choose to take 4 **HEA** damage and 2 **WIL** damage to avoid your will breaking.
  - You fall out of the stance if you fail to make an attack roll by the end of your turn or if you are dazed, stunned, or exposed. You cannot enter the rage stance if you are dazed, stunned, or exposed.
- **Martial Pursuit:** You were trained to use your rage to kill your foes.
  - **Berserker's Frenzy:** Whenever you wound or kill an enemy while raging, you may immediately perform an additional attack action with the same weapon against any viable target without spending **STA**. You cannot perform a move action before this attack. This effect can trigger multiple times per round.
  - **Raider's Cruelty:** Whenever you wound an enemy while raging, you may choose any result lower on the injury table instead of the injury rolled. You still treat the injury as the injury level rolled if you take advantage of this feature. Whenever you kill an enemy while raging, you regain 4 **STA** and 4 **WIL**.
  - **Skirmisher's Quarry:** Once per round as a free action, you may designate a target you can see as your quarry. When you have a quarry and are raging, once per round as a free action, you may shift a number of squares equal to your **DEX** towards them. The skirmisher's quarry remains active until the quarry is defeated. You may only have one quarry at a time.
- **Martial Practices:** Useful techniques warriors learn.
  - **Courier's Training:**: You can spend ten minutes stretching and breathing before a run. If you do so, you can run without stopping for a time. Make an **END** check. On success, you can run for 24 hours without stopping. On failure, you can run for 12 hours without stopping.
  - **Feign Death:** You slow your heartbeat and breathing to be imperceptible to creatures. You appear unconscious, but are aware of your surroundings. You can emerge from this state as a free action. Creatures have -4 to checks to avoid being surprised by this.
  - **Silent Speech:**: You can communicate via pantomime. Your sentences cannot be longer than three words or communicate abstract concepts such as love, but any creature can understand simple dialog like asking where an animal went, coordinating when to move or attack, or asking where fresh water is.
  - **Tame Beast**: Using your voice and hands, you are able to tame a non-hostile, non-human creature. If it is an animal that can be ridden, it will allow you to mount it. It will listen to your commands as long as they do not put it in danger. If you succeed on **SPI** or **INT** checks, it will follow a dangerous command.
  - **Tracker:**: You can examine tracks left by a creature or creature(s). You can tell what type of creature left the tracks, their numbers, the direction they're heading. Make an **INT** check. On success, you can also tell their pace, if they're wounded, and what they are transporting with them.
  - **Thief's Guile:**: You hide a small object that weighs no more than 5 lbs on your person or in a structure. It cannot be found unless its container (cloak, wall, cart, etc.) is destroyed.
  - **Weather Vane:**: By examining the sky for 1 minute, you can predict what weather changes will occur (if any) up to 20 miles away and when the weather will change.

### Level 2

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 3

Learn 3 of the following attack attributes. You can apply 1 attribute to a standard attack or 2 attributes at the cost of 3 **WIL**. You cannot apply more than 2 attributes to one attack.

- **Biter:** Requires a cruel weapon. Increase the rating of cruel by +2. If you gain a wound before the start of your next turn, increase the injury level by +2.
- **Bloody:** If the attack hits or misses, every character in a close burst 1 of the target including yourself gains the bleeding (2) condition.
- **Evasive:** If the attack hits or misses, you may shift a number of squares equal to your **END**.
- **Exhausting:** If the attack hits or misses, the target takes **STA** damage equal to your 4 + **END** and you take 4 **STA** damage.
- **Furious:** If the attack hits, you ignore all damage that originally targets **WIL** until the start of your next turn. Damage split to **WIL** from raging still decreases it.
- **Hack and Slash:** If you add your **STR** to the attack roll, also add your **DEX** to the roll and take damage equal to your **DEX** afterwards. If you add your **DEX** to the attack roll, also add your **STR** and take damage equal to your **STR** afterwards. If the attack roll adds both, then you add nothing.
- **Knockdown:** Requires a two-handed weapon. If the attack hits, the target is knocked prone.
- **Nimble:** If the attack hits, for the rest of your turn, you do not provoke opportunity attacks.
- **Shatter:** Requires a two-handed weapon and a single target. Whether the attack hits or misses, creatures in a close burst 1 of the target including yourself, take 2 damage.
- **Tempest:** Requires a two-handed weapon or dual wielding weapons. The attack's range changes to close burst 1 and you take damage equal to your **STR** or **DEX**, whichever is higher.

### Level 4

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 5

You gain one of the following benefits while in a rage stance:

- **Bear's Rage:** When you hit with a melee attack, you knock the target prone. If the target is already prone, then they take extra damage equal to your **STR**.
- **Elephant's Rage:** You gain **HEA**, **STA**, and **WIL** regeneration equal to your **SPI**.
- **Serpent's Rage:** You gain a +2 bonus to **SPE** and can shift a number of squares equal to your **DEX** as a move action.

## Feats

You must have at least one level in this class to take the following feats:

- **Cruel Bleeder:** If you wound a foe and they gain a bleeding condition, increase the rating by your **SPI**.
- **Cruel Drainer:** If you wound a foe and they lose stamina, increase the amount they lose by twice your **SPI**. If you wound a foe and they gain the exhausting condition, increase the rating by your **SPI**.

- **Hasty Defense:** When you perform the dodge action and an attack misses you, you may regain 3 **STA** and shift one square.

- **Raging Boar:** Add +2 to charge attacks while in the rage stance.
- **Raging Focus:** When you enter the rage stance, you may immediately remove one condition that is afflicting you that is not from a wound.
- **Raging Vitality:** Instead of gaining +2 **HEA** for each point of **VIT**, you instead gain +4 **HEA**. This is retroactive. Recalculate your health as if this were true from level 1.
- **Raging Will:** When you gain the dazed, stunned, or exposed condition (unless the exposed condition occurs from draining your **STA**) you may spend a rage to discard it.
- **Rampage:** Requires you be in the rage stance. If you wound or kill a foe that is not a minion, regain 3 **STA** and 3 **WIL**.
- **Varied Assault:** When you wound or kill with a thrown weapon, you may perform a charge as a free action.
