## Features

The Magus class has access to the magus exit feature, magus rituals feature, magus shield feature, cantrip feature, and spell attack attributes feature.

### Magus Exit

Once per skirmish as a move action, you may move up to your speed and at any point enter a natural object such as a tree or boulder and reappear up to 20 squares away from behind another natural object.

### Magus Rituals

You start with the Ritualist feat for free.

### Magus Shield

As a free action on your turn, you may spend 6 **WIL** to gain +8 **DEF**. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

### Cantrip Options

Each Magus cantrip requires a magical implement.

- **Magus Light:** As a standard action, shed bright light from your magical implement in a close burst 2 and dim light in a close burst 6. Increase both bursts by 1 for every point of **WIL** you spend. This effect lasts for one minute.
- **Magus Hand:** As a standard action, you conjure an ethereal hand up to 10 squares away. This hand is the same size as your own. It can carry 1 **ENC** worth of items and move with 5 **SPE**. If it has to make a check, it uses your ability scores. Concentration (1).
- **Magus Illusion:** As a standard action, you conjure an illusion up to 10 squares away. This illusion cannot be larger than a human. If the illusion is touched it fades instantly. Concentration (1) to keep the same illusion alive.
- **Magus Sound:** As a standard action, you conjure a sound as quiet as whispering or as loud as shouting up to 10 squares away. The sound may be a creature sound or a nonvocal sound such as a falling rock or wind.

### Spell Attack Attributes

Select 4 spell attack attributes you know. You can apply an attribute to a standard spell attack at the cost of 3 **WIL**. The maximum number of spell attributes you can apply to an attack is equal to your level.

- **Area:** The range is the same except instead of a single target it hits in a burst 2.
- **Blast:** The range becomes blast 3.
- **Burst:** The range becomes close burst 3.
- **Close:** The attack must be single target and against a target 1 square away. The attack does not trigger opportunity attacks. Whether the attack deals damage or not, the target is pushed a number of squares equal to your **INT**.
- **Dazzle:** Targets hit by the attack and who have their will broken gain your choice of the dazed or stunned condition (but not both) instead of rolling on the broken will table.
- **Dishearten:** Targets hit by the attack have -2 to all attack rolls until the start of your next turn.
- **Domination:** The attack must be single target. If the attack breaks the target's will, they gain the domination condition. At the start of the target's turn, as a free action before they roll for saves, you may force them to perform a move or standard action.
- **Expose:** Targets hit by the attack grant combat advantage until the start of your next turn.
- **Knockdown:** Targets hit by the attack are knocked prone.
- **Line:** The range becomes line 10.
- **Overpower:** The attack must be single target. Add **INT** and **MIN** to the attack roll.
- **Pull:** The attack pulls each target 2 squares towards you or the origin of the attack (ex: center of an area spell).
- **Push:** The attack pushes each target 2 squares from you or the origin of the attack (ex: center of an area spell).
- **Sigil:** Requires the attack to be single target. A magic rune appears on the targeted square. Describe the intended attack. Instead of performing the attack immediately, the attack is stored in the sigil. When any creature enters that square besides you, the described attack is triggered immediately and performed as a reaction as if you were still there. You may perform this reaction multiple times per round at the cost of 3 **WIL** for each additional reaction. You may only have a number up to your **INT** active at a time. They last for up to an hour.
- **Sniper:** Requires the attack to be single target. The range increases by 6 + **INT**.
- **Targeted:** Select a number of targets up to your **INT** within range of the attack.
- **Wall:** This attribute cannot be combined with other attributes. If this attribute is selected, the spell does no damage. Instead, create a wall using your spell attack range with a number of sections equal to **INT** + **MIN**. Concentration (1). The wall is 2 squares tall and appears like a cloud of fog, blocking line of sight. Each section of the wall has 1 **HEA** and attacks against **STA** or **WIL** deal **HEA** damage to it. If a section is destroyed, other portions of the wall remain active.
- **Zone:** The squares of this attack leave behind a zone. Concentration (1). If there is only a range modifier applied to this spell, then the caster may choose to not roll an attack as part of the spell and only create the zone. Choose from one of the following zone effects:
  - **Cracked Earth:** The zone is difficult terrain.
  - **Dome:** The zone's edge is surrounded by a dome of magic. Ranged and spell attacks stop if they intersect with the dome. The dome has 50 **HEA**.
  - **Feeble:** Anyone in the zone subtracts -4 to all attack rolls.
  - **Sleep:** If anyone in the zone has their will broken, they do not roll and instead immediately gain the unconscious condition.
  - **Web:** Anyone who enters the zone or starts their turn there gain the slowed condition. If they already have the slowed condition, they gain the immobilized condition instead.
