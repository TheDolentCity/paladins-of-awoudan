## Levels

When you take a level in this class after level one, increase your health by 1, stamina by 1, willpower by 4, and luster by 2.    

### Level 1

All Paladins of the Celadon Tower have the same three features: wizard's exit, cantrips, and spell attributes. Choose 1 cantrip and 6 attributes or 2 cantrips and 4 attributes. You can apply 1 attribute to a standard spell attack. Add additional attributes at the cost of 3 **WIL** each. You cannot apply more than 3 attributes to one attack or apply multiple range attributes.

- **Wizard's Exit:** Once per skirmish as a move action, you may move up to your speed and at any point enter a natural object such as a tree or boulder and reappear up to 20 squares away from behind another natural object.
- **Cantrips:** Weak, but useful spells.
  - **Magus Light:** Requires a magical implement. As a standard action, shed bright light from your magical implement in a close burst 2 and dim light in a close burst 6. Increase both bursts by 1 for every point of **WIL** you spend. This effect lasts for one minute.
  - **Magus Hand:** As a standard action, you conjure an ethereal hand up to 10 squares away. This hand is the same size as your own. It can carry 1 **ENC** worth of items and move with 5 **SPE**. If it has to make a check, it uses your ability scores. Concentration (1).
  - **Magus Illusion:** As a standard action, you conjure an illusion up to 10 squares away. This illusion cannot be larger than a human. If the illusion is touched it fades instantly. Concentration (1) to keep the same illusion alive.
  - **Magus Sound:** As a standard action, you conjure a sound as quiet as whispering or as loud as shouting up to 10 squares away. The sound may be a creature sound or a nonvocal sound such as a falling rock or wind.
- **Spell Attributes:** Modify attacks with magic implements.
  - **Area:** The range is the same except instead of a single target it hits in a burst 2.
  - **Blast:** The range becomes blast 3.
  - **Burst:** The range becomes close burst 3.
  - **Close:** The attack must be single target and against a target 1 square away. The attack does not trigger opportunity attacks. Whether the attack deals damage or not, the target is pushed a number of squares equal to your **INT**.
  - **Dazzle:** Targets hit by the attack gain the dazed condition.
  - **Dishearten:** Targets hit by the attack have -2 to all attack rolls. Increase the penalty by -2 for every 3 points of **WIL** you spend. The maximum penalty is equal to twice your **MIN**. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
  - **Domination:** The attack must be single target and target **WIL**. If the attack breaks the target's will, they gain the domination condition. At the start of the target's turn, as a free action before they roll for saves, you may force them to perform a move action.
  - **Expose:** Targets hit by the attack have -2 to **DEF**. Increase the penalty by -2 for every 6 points of **WIL** you spend. The maximum penalty is equal to twice your **MIN**. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
  - **Knockdown:** Targets hit by the attack are knocked prone.
  - **Light:** The attack conjures bright light in each square it strikes and dim light in every adjacent square.
  - **Line:** The range becomes line 10.
  - **Overpower:** The attack must be single target and target **WIL**. Add **INT** and **MIN** to the attack roll.
  - **Pull:** The attack pulls each target 2 squares towards you or the origin of the attack (ex: center of an area spell). Increase the amount of squares pulled by 1 for every 3 points of **WIL** you spend. The maximum number of squares is equal to your **INT** (minimum 2).
  - **Push:** The attack pushes each target 2 squares from you or the origin of the attack (ex: center of an area spell). Increase the amount of squares pushed by 1 for every 3 points of **WIL** you spend. The maximum number of squares is equal to your **INT** (minimum 2).
  - **Shield:** Gain +6 **DEF** until the start of your next turn.
  - **Sigil:** A magic rune appears on the targeted square. Describe the intended attack. Instead of performing the attack immediately, the attack is stored in the sigil. When any creature enters that square besides you, the described attack is triggered immediately and performed as a reaction as if you were still there. You may perform this reaction multiple times per round at the cost of 6 **WIL** for each additional reaction. This attack can conjure multiple sigils, but you may only have a number up to your **INT** active at a time. They last for up to an hour.
  - **Slide:** The attack slides each target 1 square for every 3 **WIL** you spend. The maximum number of squares is equal to your **INT** (minimum 2).
  - **Shatter:** The attack targets **HEA** instead of **STA** or **WIL** and deals 5x damage to all objects that are struck by the attack.
  - **Sniper:** Requires the attack to be single target. The range increases by 6 + **INT**.
  - **Targeted:** Select a number of targets up to your **INT** within range of the attack.
  - **Wall:** This attribute cannot be combined with other attributes. If this attribute is selected, the spell does no damage. Instead, create a wall using your spell attack range with a number of sections equal to **INT** + **MIN**. Concentration (1). The wall is 2 squares tall and appears like a cloud of fog, blocking line of sight. Each section of the wall has 1 **HEA** and attacks against **STA** or **WIL** deal **HEA** damage to it. If a section is destroyed, other portions of the wall remain active.
  - **Ward:** Targets of the attack, not including yourself, gain +2 **DEF** and +2 **FOC** until the start of your next turn.
  - **Zone:** The squares of this attack leave behind a zone. Concentration (1). If there is only a range modifier applied to this spell, then the caster may choose to not roll an attack as part of the spell and only create the zone. Choose from one of the following zone effects:
    - **Cracked Earth:** The zone is difficult terrain.
    - **Dome:** The zone's edge is surrounded by a dome of magic. Ranged and magic attacks stop if they intersect with the dome. The dome has 50 **HEA**.
    - **Feeble:** Anyone in the zone subtracts -4 to all attack rolls.
    - **Sleep:** If anyone in the zone had their will broken this round, they do not roll and instead immediately gain the unconscious condition. If anyone in the zone later has their will broken, they also do not roll and gain the unconscious condition.
    - **Web:** Anyone who enters the zone or starts their turn there gain the slowed condition. If they already have the slowed condition, they gain the immobilized condition instead.

### Level 2

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 3

Learn one cantrip and one spell attribute or learn two spell attributes.

### Level 4

Increase two different ability scores by +1 and take a new feat.

### Level 5

Take one of the following daily spells:

- **Storm:** As a standard action, summon a great storm of gale force winds and rain (or snow). The storm has a range of 1 mile. The storm creates huge waves over water, floods the nearby lowlands after one hour, and disappears after 1 + d4 hours. While the storm is active, at the start of every character in the storm's turn, they are pushed d6 squares in a random direction (d8 → 1:N, 2:NE, 3:E, 4:SE, 5:S, 6:SW, 7:W, 8:NW). You are not affected by the spell and you may designate a number of targets up to your **DEX** who are not affected by the wind.
- **Wall of Force:** As a standard action, create a wall of force using your spell attack range with a number of sections equal to 8 + **INT** + **MIN**. Concentration (2). The wall is up to 8 squares tall and appears like a cloud of fog, blocking line of sight. The wall has 500 **HEA** and attacks against **STA** or **WIL** deal **HEA** damage to it. If the wall is destroyed, each section explodes and deals 5d10 damage in a close burst 8. Characters only take 5d10 even if they are within multiple close bursts of the wall.
- **Wizard's Passage:** As a standard action, you discover a secret passageway in a natural formation such as a tree or boulder that leads to another natural formation up to 100 squares away. You and allies can enter this passageway as a move action. At the start of your next turn, you appear at the exit. The passageway persists forever.

- **Careful Spellcraft:** You may designate a number of creatures up to your **DEX** that are not affected by your area, burst, and blast spells.
