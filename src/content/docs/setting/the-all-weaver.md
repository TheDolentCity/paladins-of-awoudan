Before man, before beasts, before even the Gods, there was the All-Weaver.

The All-Weaver was the daughter of Light and Darkness, sibling to Sun and Moon. They rested on the Earth and watched a thousand thousand passages of Sun and Moon. After an eternity studying the gifts of warmth and light from their siblings, All-Weaver decided that they would create a gift in return.

With water and earth, they formed a clay. Along with the warmth of Sun, All-Weaver used their own flesh and essence to weave life into the clay. Beasts, humans, plants, and fungi spread across the surface of the world. There was not enough of All-Weaver left over to remain whole, so they tore their own threads and scattered themselves as a plethora of gods. The twelve greatest of these were the Fell Gods.

This weaving is the basis of all magic in the world. When a magician casts a spell, it is the threads in their own body reaching out and tugging at invisible threads in the world around them.
