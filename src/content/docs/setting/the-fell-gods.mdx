The twelve Fell Gods were sealed away by the Christian God when his followers conquered the land. Many ancient rites and knowledge were destroyed in a great purge. But when God was slain, the Fell Gods were released.

Each Fell God has a rune, symbol, several domains, and known appearance. There are six masculine gods and six feminine gods, although several will adopt both forms.

### Aflo • The Father
