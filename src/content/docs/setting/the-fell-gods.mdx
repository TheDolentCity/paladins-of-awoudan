The twelve Fell Gods were sealed away by the Christian God when his followers conquered the land. Many ancient rites and knowledge were destroyed in a great purge. But when God was slain, the Fell Gods were released.

There are other gods, smaller gods, but they serve the Fell Gods, or the turning of time and the aging of the world.

Each Fell God has several domains, symbols, and known appearances. The first three items under a God's title are their domains, the last three are their symbols. There are six masculine gods and six feminine gods, although several will adopt both forms.

### Aflo • The Father
