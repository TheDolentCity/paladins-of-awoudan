title: The Scribe Skin
description: Midwives cried louder than you as you were born. Your flesh was marred, at first they thought it bled. The letters and logograms of men, not only those of your language, were tattooed across all your skin. They shimmer and shift, unreadable to all. This is an omen of Rygg.

## Ability

When you touch any writing, no matter the language, your eyes glow golden and you see hallucinations of the letters shift before you and you can read the words inscribed there.
