title: The Red Moon
description: When the clouds parted, all could see the full moon was blood red. Several sailors went to the docks to secure their ships in anticipation of some violence from the sea. Instead, they found a skiff washed ashore. Inside, an exsanguinated woman and a baby wrapped in a basket. This is an omen of Magi.

## Ability

Marked by a god of sea and storms, born in by a wayward current under a red Moon, you are a conduit for Magi's fury. As your own anger rises, nearby bodies of water rise in turn. Rivers rush and froth, lakes overflow, and dams burst. As you grow calm, water levels decrease or abate entirely.
