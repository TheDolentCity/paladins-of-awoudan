title: The Stolen Child
description: You were stolen the night of your birth. Your parents were distraught and hunters were summoned. You were not found. A week after your birth, you were discovered on your parent's doorstep, unharmed and unchanged. Except to your mother. She insisted that it wasn't you, that a new child had taken your place. She would have nothing to do with you and many are wary around you. This is an omen of Ormu.

## Ability

Your true face is unnerving to all folk, but you can perfectly mimic the voice of those close to you. If you spend a week of concerted effort to learn someone's voice, you can also mimic them.
