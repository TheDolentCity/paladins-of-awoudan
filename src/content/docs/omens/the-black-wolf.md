title: The Black Wolf
description: Your birth was quick and easy. Late at night, while you cried in your mother's arms, a great, black wolf entered your home. Transfixed, your mother was pale and still. The wolf approached and with bloody maw dispensed hunter's blood, drop by drop, into your babe mouth. Your crying stopped. This is an omen of Tian.

## Ability

Wolves are drawn to you and will share what food and shelter they have with you. They do not observe commands, but they treat you as they would a pup. Additionally, you have longer, sharper canines. If you attack with these, use the stats for a dagger.
