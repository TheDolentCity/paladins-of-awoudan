title: The Eagle Born
description: An awkward squawk from above alerted your parents. The eagle swooped down suddenly, dropping a brightly-colored bundle. A great screeching erupted when the bundle hit the ground. Your parents unwrapped it to find you, a babe, with bloody wounds from an eagle's claws. You bear these scars for life. This is an omen of Hedr.
