title: The Scarred Face
description: The midwives would not hand you to your mother for fear of how she would react. Her screams were expected. Your face was born with a gruesome scar in the shape of a scythe. It carved over your brow, across your nose and cheeks. This is an omen of Jori.

## Ability

You have an innate insight regarding crops. When you look at a field of crops, you receive a portent that may yet be averted. You can sense a blight in late autumn, or torrential rains and floods in late spring. If the farmers listen to you, they may save their crops, but few can meet your eyes.
