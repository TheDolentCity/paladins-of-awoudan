title: The Flame Kissed
description: Screams were heard from a burning building. A brave man entered and found a babe alone, its bassinet aflame. With great effort and injury, he retrieved you from the fiery carriage. Your body was burned, but you survived. Flame left its marks on your face, hands, and chest. This is an omen of Daen.

## Ability

While your visage is scarred, your voice is anything but. It is beautiful, capable of both the lowest and highest notes. When woven with song, it is intoxicating. If you choose to a sing a song to calm the hearts and minds of those around you and sing the song to completion, all but you fall asleep.
