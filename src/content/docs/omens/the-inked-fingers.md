title: The Inked Fingers
description: You cried out when you were born and so too did the midwives. Your flesh appeared healthy and well-grown, but the tips of your fingers were black as night, darker than any pigment. They look as if they had been dipped in a well of nothing, leaving behind pure oblivion. This is an omen of Virr.

### Ability

Your fingertips do not reflect light in the way living things should. They are frightening to behold for any creatures, save umbral creatures. If you touch a creature's face their memory of the past few minutes is obliterated, never to return.
