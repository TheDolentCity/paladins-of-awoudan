title: The Bleeding Mother
description: Many women hemorrhage after birth. Some die from it. Your mother was one of these unlucky ones. But the bleeding did not stop with her death. No suture or flame could close the wound. She spilled four times the amount of blood her body could hold before her kin, witnesses to this horror, buried her in a rush. It is unknown if her body still bleeds, pouring blood deep into the earth. This is an omen of Wode.
