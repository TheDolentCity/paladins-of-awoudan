title: The Desolate Home
description: When you were finally delivered your mother was exhausted. After a short feeding, the family put to bed. They were too tired to wake quickly to your cries. Instead, they woke to their home wreathed in flame. They were able to get you out, but not all of them survived. It wasn't your fault, you were only hungry. This is an omen of Aflo.

_When you were finally delivered your mother was exhausted. After a short feeding, the family put to bed. They were too tired to wake quickly to your cries. Instead, they woke to their home wreathed in flame. They were able to get you out, but not all of them survived. It wasn't your fault, you were only hungry. Devastating fires like this followed you throughout your life. This is an omen of Aflo._

## Ability

You cannot control this ability. Instead, when you are upset, angry, or in pain, the blessing of Aflo shows itself. Your dominant hand is wreathed in flame. The hand itself is immune to flame and heat, but the rest of your body is not. Touching flammable objects lights them aflame and if you strike anyone with it, they gain the burning 2 condition.
